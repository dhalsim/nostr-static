Free agency’s a wild west shootout, the draft’s a blind bet, and this division’s always a brutal cage match of toughness and trash talk. The Bengals and Ravens duked it out in 2024, the Steelers hung tough, and the Browns… well, they Brownsed. Let’s throw some records on this grinder and see who’s got the grit to claim the crown. Here we go, fam—pass the Iron City.\n\n**Cincinnati Bengals: 11-6 – Burrow’s Back with a Vengeance**\n\nThe Bengals were a force in 2024, and 2025’s shaping up as Joe Burrow’s revenge tour. With Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins (assuming they keep him) torching DBs, this offense is a video game cheat code. The O-line’s finally decent, and the defense—Logan Wilson, Trey Hendrickson—if he stays, brings the pain when it matters. Roster changes are a hurdle—Higgins and Hendrickson might chase a mega-deal elsewhere—but Burrow’s ice-cold clutch factor seals it. 11-6, division champs. Cincy’s ready to remind everyone who dey really are. \n\n### **Baltimore Ravens: 10-7 – Lamar’s Still a Freak** \n\nThe Ravens are the AFC North’s relentless machine. Lamar Jackson’s running circles around defenses, Derrick Henry’s still trucking fools (if he’s back), and Zay Flowers keeps the passing game spicy. That defense—Roquan Smith, Kyle Hamilton—is a brick wall, but free agency could bite. Justin Madubuike SHOULD stay, and the secondary’s got holes to patch. 10-7’s the call, snagging a wildcard. They’re a half-step behind Cincy but built to ruin someone’s playoff dreams.\n\n### **Pittsburgh Steelers: 9-8 – Tomlin’s Eternal .500 Magic**\n\nMike Tomlin’s Steelers are the NFL’s cockroaches—impossible to kill. Russell Wilson initially steadied the ship in 2024, and with Najee Harris pounding the rock and George Pickens stretching the field, they’ve got enough juice. The defense—T.J. Watt, Cam Heyward (if he’s still kicking)—is still a nightmare, but age and free agency loom. Patrick Queen could bolt, the Steelers need to settle on a QB, and the secondary’s thin. 9-8’s classic Tomlin—competitive, scrappy, maybe a wildcard if the stars align. Pittsburgh doesn’t die; it just reloads.\n\n### **Cleveland Browns: 6-11 – Deshaun’s Last Stand?**\n\nThe Browns are the AFC North’s punching bag, and 2025 ain’t looking much brighter. Deshaun Watson’s a $230 million question mark—Nick Chubb’s back, Jerry Jeudy’s a weapon, but that O-line’s shaky. The defense—Myles Garrett, Denzel Ward—keeps ‘em in games, but free agency might swipe Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, and the vibes are off. 6-11’s the harsh truth—too much baggage, not enough spark. Cleveland’s stuck in neutral ‘til they figure out QB. \n\n### **The Final Bell** \n\nThe AFC North in 2025 is a Cincinnati coronation with a bloody chase. The Bengals (11-6) take the title because Burrow’s a killer, the Ravens (10-7) claw a wildcard with Lamar’s wizardry, the Steelers (9-8) hang tough, and the Browns (6-11) wallow. Free agency’s the game-changer—lose a stud, you’re screwed; keep ‘em, you’re cooking. Hit me on Nostr when I butcher this, but this is my AFC North gospel. Let’s roll, degenerates.

How much is too much, though? And how much time should we keep spending re-adapting our content to reach all of our network?\n\nFor work, I've found myself having to create accounts in several of these giant data hoarding companies, having to build each following from scratch and to create \"content\" for all, and having to go through the hurdle of posting everything, everywhere, all at once.\n\n## I'm sick of ever-changing terms, conditions and capabilities.\n\nLet's be honest, the majority of us have never ever read the full terms and conditions, let alone every time they are updated without us knowing which rights to our data we are giving away, and which terms we are accepting that may be detrimental to us and our mental health.\n\nWe've learnt to accept that we are in their playground, they make up the rules, and if they choose to change the rules mid-game we just need to swallow it. We literally have no other choice, it's either that or desertion, which basically means walking away from everything we've built on their \"public square\". So, like a carefully engineered detrimental incentive structure, the more time we spend building on their turf, the more we are tied to them and conditioned to never leave them. The more we build and make them grow on our content, the more we'll lose if or when we drop out.\n\nAnd even if you accept all that and choose to play along, and you do your best to create the most awesome account in the neighborhood, the random changes they make to optimize ad revenue or user attention will inevitably affect you and all your work.\n\nIf you created all your feed according to Instagram's squares but they choose to change to TikTok style dimensions due to their tech positioning battle with the Chinese giant... You swallow. If you edited your reels according to what you felt was the best 100 seconds video... Not anymore, suddenly 90 seconds is the maximum you're allowed... No appeal, no options. You Swallow. What? Seeing less of the people you actually WANT TO FOLLOW because they decided to clutter your feed with ads and suggestions, guess again: YOU SWALLOW.\n\nAREN'T YOU FEELING FULL ENOUGH OF ALL THE SHIT THEY'VE FORCED DOWN YOUR THROAT?\n\nLiving our digital lives on these platforms feels like standing on ever changing quicksand, never endingly trying to \"hack the algorithm\" in order to have our content placed in front of the people who should automatically be able to see us from the moment they chose to follow us; and the worst part of it is, you never know when you may lose it all.\n\n## Let's not forget, your social media account is NOT REALLY YOURS.\n\nRecently, a friend's social media account was hacked. She didn't know how it happened; all she knew is that she got an email from Meta saying she had acted against community guidelines and her accounts were therefore being removed (the one hacked and all those liked to her email, which meant personal and work accounts). She tried to appeal, to no avail. She hadn't done anything wrong, but suddenly her identity had disappeared from all our feeds, and her content didn't exist anywhere anymore. She lost plenty of photos she had always counted on finding on her Instagram and lost the people she followed and who followed her. It was as if she had never existed on the platform.\n\n*(Looks like a good moment to remind you to download all your valued content from the platforms you use in case something like this happens to you)*\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/f288a224a61b7361aa9dc41a90aba8a2dff4544db0bc386728e638b21da1792c/files/1739976994345-YAKIHONNES3.jpeg)And this happened to someone who hadn't done anything \"to deserve it\". It has actually happened to more than one person I know, and every time they've been helpless and had no recourse, and yet, found themselves having to rebuild from scratch on the same platform that de-platformed them, because they had \"no other option\", and \"their friends are there\".\n\nMany more people have encountered this awful wake up call, some because of a hack, like my friend, others found themselves removed because they posted content critical of the platform... there are so many reasons people have gotten de-platformed and posts have gotten deleted without warning. And every time, we accept it, as if we owe them something; as if we need to settle for this kind of abusive environment that gets rich on our content and attention without having a say in anything. \n\nBut we do have another option that flips that attention retention model completely on its head and empowers the user. **That option is NOSTR, our exit from the extractive social media silos they have trapped us into.**\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/f288a224a61b7361aa9dc41a90aba8a2dff4544db0bc386728e638b21da1792c/files/1739977741374-YAKIHONNES3.JPG)\n\n# NOSTR: The better social experience for the internet era.\n\nNOSTR (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is not a social media app, it's an Internet protocol. It's open source and many many developers around the world are creating apps on top of it and creating THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERIENCE for users.\n\nI first heard of NOSTR from Jack Dorsey on what used to be called Twitter, and when I joined it two years ago it was really rough around the edges, but it was FULL OF POTENTIAL and the value proposition was very clear to me from the beginning.\n\n## Firstly, YOU OWN YOUR IDENTITY, that includes your content and your follower list.\n\nSo, what does owning you identity mean? I guess many of us have thought we owned our identity before, but the reality is that the platforms owned our identities, which is why they could delete or censor us.\n\nOwning your identity on NOSTR is empowered by encryption and cryptography. I'm not going to go into the technical part, but to explain as simply as I can, on NOSTR no platform owns your login and password to use on their playground; you can basically use any NOSTR app to create your identity to navigate it. They give you a login (npub) and password (nsec), and the magic part is that you can USE THAT IDENTITY ON ANY NOSTR APP OR WEBSITE, no need to sign up individually on each one.\n\n## Welcome to the beauty of INTEROPERABILITY.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough what it feels like to be able to take your identity, your followers, your content and carry it from one app to the other.\n\nOn NOSTR there is a rich ecosystem of apps and websites that keep growing. We have \"clients\" that allow you to experience NOSTR in interfaces that could remind you of Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Substack, Twitch, Clubhouse, Podcast apps and many more. You can find many of them on https://nostrapps.com/ .\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/f288a224a61b7361aa9dc41a90aba8a2dff4544db0bc386728e638b21da1792c/files/1739977137118-YAKIHONNES3.PNG)\n\nWith that information in mind, imagine you only needed one user password, your NOSTR nsec, and with that key, you could open you Instagram, or your Twitch or your Substack. And all your followers would be there, and you could choose what type of content you wanted to link to your identity for your followers to find. No longer \"find link in bio\", or \"go to our YouTube channel\", everything you post on NOSTR is tied to your identity, and you can post it all with a single set of keys that posts your content \"everywhere\". \n\nAnd since your content is \"in every client\", each of YOUR FOLLOWERS CAN CHOOSE if they are more interested in experiencing your photography content \"Insta-like\" or if they love your \"Twitter-esque\" notes better. Each user navigates NOSTR with the interface they prefer.\n\n*(With great power comes great responsibility, and I feel obligated to tell you that if you ever lose your nsec, no platform is gonna be able to save you. It's like the keys to your house, unless you keep a copy safely, no one can open it for you (there are no locksmiths on NOSTR). And if you leave your keys lying around on a cloud server somewhere, someone may grab your keys, open your house and use it however they want).*\n\nThe beauty of this interoperability and the fact that my keys open up my identity to all the NOSTR realms is that you don't need to settle for one client. I use 5 to 6 clients regularly everyday depending on the mood I'm in, (or the bugs that still prove this is a nascent ecosystem in development). Some I use when I want a more \"Twitter-like\" experience, others when I want to browse photos and others just give different algorithms to choose how to view my feed, and the best part is NO ONE CAN CLUTTER MY FEED WITH ADS. I can curate my feed however is most important to me, and each \"NOSTR client\" is like a different skin that customizes the way I experience the content.\n\nHowever, the most important reason I started to use different NOSTR apps was that when I started, not all apps had zapping integrated. Some still don't, but most do :)\n\n## ZAPS: direct micropayments from your followers.\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/f288a224a61b7361aa9dc41a90aba8a2dff4544db0bc386728e638b21da1792c/files/1739977600868-YAKIHONNES3.JPG)\n\nZaps are tips that come directly from the people who find value in the shit that you post. They are micropayments in the form of \"sats\", fractions of ever-increasing in value bitcoin , and a very big reason why I'm spending less and less time on other social media accumulating valueless likes that only feed the algorithm, and more time on NOSTR interacting with humans that post valuable notes hoping the generous souls that run upon their art or creations will find them valuable enough to tip them for it.\n\nIt's crazy how the type of content you post can change when your incentive is not to feed an algo, but to give real value to other humans around the world and be your most authentic self. Where Twitter/X's algo benefited the type of incendiary content that shocked and outraged people, NOSTR's incentives benefit those who bring most value to the network and their peers.\n\nA few sats tip may not seem much, but even if the equivalent of a small zap is merely cents, it feels a whole lot better than any like, and you can count that if the purchasing power of bitcoin continues to accrue, those value-earned tips will too. Many \"nostriches\" are getting tons of zaps for memes on NOSTR, valuable articles, videos or participation in zapathons .\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/f288a224a61b7361aa9dc41a90aba8a2dff4544db0bc386728e638b21da1792c/files/1739977639766-YAKIHONNES3.JPG)\n\nIn NOSTR is where I first heard of the concept \"value for value\", and the community is very adamant in making \"v4v\" an alternative to ad revenue driven models. **Because we need to be the change we wanna see in the world**.\n\nWe've heard it said that if you're not paying for the product, you are the product. And up until now that has meant we felt obliged to accept that since ads were paying the platforms, we were required to give them our attention. But the open source movement thinks we deserve better. We deserve a better Internet, like the decentralized promise we've slowly been robbed of to enrich 10 people out of the work of all of us. If they can't monetize our attention, they got nothing. \n\nBut why should they monetize it, instead of us?\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/f288a224a61b7361aa9dc41a90aba8a2dff4544db0bc386728e638b21da1792c/files/1739977714122-YAKIHONNES3.JPG)\n\n## Even with the glitches and bugs, NOSTR ROCKS!\n\nThe things I've grown to love most about NOSTR are:\n\n• Not having the clutter of ads on my feed and being able to ONLY SEE WHAT I CHOOSE TO SEE.\n\n• People who are not on NOSTR can ENJOY MY STUFF WITHOUT HAVING TO LOGIN.\n\n• Being able to ENJOY ALL THE BENEFITS OF INTEROPERABILITY, and use many NOSTR clients that enrich my user experience knowing I own my identity and that means I'm not locked in, I can move like a bird wherever I decide.\n\n• ZAPPING complete strangers that made me laugh, gave me a cool insight or simply made a witty comment.\n\n• GETTING TIPPED for memes, articles, photos, videos and any \"Notes and Other Stuff\" that people have found valuable.\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/f288a224a61b7361aa9dc41a90aba8a2dff4544db0bc386728e638b21da1792c/files/1739977910408-YAKIHONNES3.JPG)\n\n# CONCLUSION: Join us on NOSTR, participate in claiming back your digital life.\n\nIf you've made it this far in my love letter to NOSTR, thank you for being interested. Curious minds is what the world needs more of \u0026lt;3.\n\nNOSTR is an ecosystem that is being built in the open by relentless developers that are continuously striving to out compete each other to offer a better user experience, it's a many headed dragon that has constant upgrades and implementations which benefits us all, and as such it sometimes comes with bugs and glitches.\n\nBuilding the future is always buggy and requires testers and early adopters that help shape the technology in the best way possible, especially if you wanna build outside the incentive models of the devouring giants we're trying to get away from.\n\nBeing such an open ecosystem can also be overwhelming for a newcomer, where to start? There are so many clients to experience; so here are some of my recommendations. \n\nPlease, don't feel you need to go through all of them now, start step by step. This article will always be here whenever you need it (this is not Instagram ;) ).\n\n### **Creating your NOSTR identity/account** with a wallet integrated to receive zaps on both Android and iOS:\n\n• **YAKIHONNE**: It's a Japanese client that offers a great on-boarding experience. From the app you can create the account and enable a wallet to receive zaps. In it you can view and post short and long form content, images, videos and more. (Once you have the account created on your app, you can also visit the desktop version on https://yakihonne.com/ )\n\n• **PRIMAL**: For a while it has positioned itself as a great on-boarding NOSTR client because it offers the same things as Yakihonne, has an integrated wallet, with the added benefit that you can also \"buy sats/bitcoin\" directly from its wallet, which can come in handy (it comes with a 15-30% premium, so only use for small amounts). It also has the desktop version at primal.net.\n\n### **My favorite NOSTR iOS PHONE APPS after on-boarding**, in case you wanna hop into different user experiences:\n\n• **DAMUS**: created by the original creator of the \"ZAP\", Will Casarin, it's an iOS simple client that is reliable and fast with notifications. It keeps things simple, mostly focusing on short note content, although you can also see images and short video. But the feed is optimized as a more \"Twitter-like\" feed.\n\n• **NOSTUR**: The iOS phone client that has it all! It's the client I've used that integrates the most of NOSTR's possibilities, you can see all of the mentioned above with the previous clients, but also view LIVE STREAMS, and have multiple accounts set up simultaneously. The enhanced capabilities can sometimes come at the cost of crashing or being slow to load.\n\n• **FREERSE**: Nice clean user interface with plenty of functionality, with easy navigation on topics like #art #photography or any other interests. It's my always reliable back-up to upload image content.\n\n• **OLAS**: The new kid on the block Olas client, by prolific developer Pablof7z, is trying to take on Instagram and TikTok and has developed a client mainly focused on the visual and photographic part of NOSTR.\n\n### Desktop clients \u0026 OTHER GEMS OF THE NOSTR REALM:\n\nThere is an infinite number of clients for desktop, but I usually find myself on **ditto.pub** or **slidestr.net** for a more visual experience.\n\n• **ALBY** is INTEROPERABILITY'S BEST FRIEND. Alby is not a NOSTR client, but it's a browser extension that makes it seamless to jump from one desktop client to another with your wallet and identity without compromising your security.\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/f288a224a61b7361aa9dc41a90aba8a2dff4544db0bc386728e638b21da1792c/files/1739977959102-YAKIHONNES3.JPG)\n\n• **HIVETALK**: A video call client (reminiscent of Zoom) that doesn't track you or spy on you and that enables zapping and many other functionalities during the calls.\n\n• **NOSTR NESTS**: Audio spaces client that allows people to listen to conversations, chat within it and zap the people involved.\n\n### if you made it this far, THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.\n\nHOPE YOU FOUND VALUE IN IT AND UNDERSTOOD WHY, FOR ME, THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS BRIGHT, OPEN AND USER-CENTRIC.\n\nFUCK THE MIDDLEMEN.\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/f288a224a61b7361aa9dc41a90aba8a2dff4544db0bc386728e638b21da1792c/files/1739978070977-YAKIHONNES3.JPG)","sig":"fdfddbed3c53f98cd284964d9abe9d19c0cf339f395a97da337840c25780bd2359b150272a4c76dce2440c1264463a1546aad4802bbb3adaf37d5ae68796a49a"},"naddr1qpq4xmmkv4ex26t8de68jt25dpex7at8dqk56ct5dpjk6ct5d93hxt2rdpshgetj95ez63nfdeskucmfv9kz6st5dpjkjumd94jhg7rjwdnqz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzp0u4uxj9h40vtjsdgg8574wdq9j9c7zf74la6yacckh7cn4aejzgqvzqqqr4gu4wqgjw":{"kind":30023,"id":"89edeb499e7559115c13ce2d4f08571cb27e772730835f48cdacb870ce62e252","pubkey":"bf95e1a45bd5ec5ca0d420f4f55cd01645c7849f57fdd13b8c5afec4ebdcc848","created_at":1743170166,"tags":[["title","Sovereignty Through Mathematics Chater 2: Financial Atheism"],["summary","Bitcoin Infinity Academy - Course 1 Part 2\n"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/0e3f663c4e01d09a36fdd86c9329397e689af70fe6156513b720679ca00b1bc3.png"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","nostr"],["t","books"],["t","bitcoin books"],["t","bookstr"],["t","philosophy"],["t","bitcoin philosophy"],["published_at","1743170166"],["d","Sovereignty-Through-Mathematics-Chater-2-Financial-Atheism-etxrsf"]],"content":"This is a part of the Bitcoin Infinity Academy course on Knut Svanholm's book Bitcoin: Sovereignty Through Mathematics. For more information, check out our[ Geyser page](https://geyser.fund/project/infinity)!\n\n## Financial Atheism\n\n“Don’t trust, verify” is a common saying amongst bitcoiners that represents a sound attitude towards not only Bitcoin but all human power structures. In order to understand Bitcoin, one must admit that everything in society is man-made. Every civilization, every religion, every constitution, and every law is a product of human imagination. It wasn’t until as late as the 17th century that the scientific method started to become the dominant practice for describing how the world actually worked. Peer-to-peer review and repeated testing of a hypothesis are still quite recent human practices. Before this, we were basically just guessing and trusting authorities to a large extent. We still do this today, and despite our progress over the last couple of centuries, we still have a long way to go. Our brains are hardwired to follow the leader of the pack. The human brain is born with a plethora of cognitive biases pre-installed, and we have to work very hard to overcome them. We evolved to survive in relatively small groups, and our brains are thus not really made for seeing the bigger picture. Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm is constructed in such a way that it is easy to verify that computational power was sacrificed in order to approve a block of transactions and claim its reward. In this way, no trust in any authority is required as it is relatively trivial to test the validity of a block and the transactions it contains. This is nothing short of a complete reimagining of how human society ought to be governed. The beauty of mathematics governs the Bitcoin system. Everything that ever happens in Bitcoin is open and verifiable to everyone, even to those who are not yet using it.\n\nAfter the tragic events of 9/11 in 2001, Sam Harris started writing his book *The End of Faith*, which happened to be released around the same time as Richard Dawkins’ *The God Delusion*, Daniel Dennett's *Breaking the Spell*, and Christopher Hitchens’ *God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything*. These books kick-started what, in hindsight, has often been referred to as the new atheist movement, even though there has arguably never been anything new about atheism. Atheism must almost certainly have preceded religion since religious ideas require the person holding the idea to believe a certain doctrine or story. Atheism is nothing but the rejection of ways to describe the world that are not verifiable by experimentation. A fly on the wall is probably an atheist by this definition of the word. Atheism is often accused of being just another set of beliefs, but the word itself describes what it is much better — a lack of belief in theistic ideas. It is not a code of conduct or set of rules to live your life by; it is simply the rejection of that which cannot be scientifically verified. Many people, religious people, in particular, have a hard time grasping this. If you believe that a supernatural entity created everything in everyone's life, you might not be too comfortable with a word that describes a complete rejection of what you believe created everything, including the very atheist that the word describes. The amount of different religious worldviews that exist is probably equal to the sum of all religious people on the planet, but all world views that reject these superstitious beliefs require but one word. Atheism is not the opposite of religion but is simply the lack of it.\n\nIn 2008, another sub-culture movement of unbelief was born. Let’s call it *Financial Atheism* — the rejection of unverifiable value claims. With the invention of Bitcoin, a way of rejecting fraudulent expressions of a token’s value was born. Those of us fortunate enough to have been born in secular countries all enjoy not having the ideas of religious demagogues dictating our lives on a daily basis. We can choose which ideas to believe in and which to reject. What we still have very limited means of choosing, however, are the ways in which we express value to each other. We’re told to use a system in which we all have a certain number of value tokens assigned to our name, either as a number on a screen or as digits on paper notes. We all live in the collective hallucination that these numbers are somehow legit and that their authenticity is not to be questioned.\n\nA Bitcoin balance assigned to a certain Bitcoin address might seem just as questionable to a layman, but if you have a basic understanding of the hashing algorithms and game theory behind it, it’s not. At the time of writing, the hash of the latest block on the Bitcoin blockchain begins with eighteen zeros in a row. These zeros represent the Proof of Work that ensures that this block is valid and that every transaction in it actually happened. If you can grasp the concept of a hashing algorithm, and if you have an intuition about mathematics, you realize the gargantuan amount of calculating effort that went into finding this particular hash. It is simply mind-blowing. To forge a false version of a hash beginning with eighteen zeros just wouldn’t be economically viable. Of course, you can never actually know that a 51% attack or some other attempt at corrupting the blockchain hasn’t occurred, but you can know that such an attack would require more than half of the network acting against their own economic interest. Bitcoin is not something to believe in. You don’t need to trust any authority because you can validate the plausibility of its authenticity yourself. It’s the financial equivalent of atheism or unbelief. Satoshi wasn’t Jesus. Satoshi was Brian of Nazareth, telling his followers to think for themselves.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics, also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. The second law states that the entropy of any isolated system always increases, and the third law states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero. In the Bitcoin network, participants known as miners compete for new Bitcoin in a lottery with very fixed rules. The more hashing power (computing power) a miner contributes to the network, the higher his chances of winning the block reward, a specific amount of Bitcoin that is halved every four years. The difficulty of this lottery - in other words, the miner’s chance of winning it — is re-calibrated every 2016th block so that the average time it takes to find the next block is always roughly ten minutes. What this system produces is absolute scarcity; the amount of Bitcoin in existence at any moment in time is always predictable. The more time that passes, the slower the rate of coin issuance and the block reward slowly approaches zero. By the time it does, around the year 2140, the individual miner’s incentive to mine for a reward will, at least theoretically, have been replaced by an incentive to collect transaction fees from the participants of the network. Even now, the sum of all fees make up a non-trivial part of the miners’ revenue. Yet from a user’s point of view the fees are still very low, and as the network scales up using Layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network, they’re expected to remain low for quite a long time ahead.\n\nAbsolute scarcity is a concept that mankind has never encountered before. Arguably, this makes it the first man-made concept to ever be directly linked to the laws of physics. Everything anyone does requires a certain amount of energy. The very word *doing* implies that some kind of movement, some type of energy expenditure, needs to occur. As mentioned earlier, how we value things is entirely subjective. Different actions are of different value to different people. How we value different things is also inevitably linked to the supply of those things. Had the trapped-under-ice winter diver mentioned in chapter one been equipped with a scuba tank, he probably wouldn't have thought of his next breath as such a precious thing. The price a person is willing to pay for a good — in other words, the sum of one or more person’s actions — can be derived from two basic variables: The highly subjective *demand* for the good and the always-constrained-by-time-and-space *supply* of that same good. Note that if supply is sufficiently limited, there only needs to be a minimal amount of demand for a good for its price to increase.\n\nOne could argue that no one *needs* Bitcoin and that, therefore, Bitcoin would have no intrinsic value. One could also argue that there’s no such thing as intrinsic value since demand is always subjective. In any case, there will always be a cost to mine Bitcoin, and the more mining power in the network, the higher that cost. This cost, ensured by the Bitcoin network’s Proof-Of-Work algorithm, is probably as close to a pure energy cost as the price of a human activity will ever get. Once the mining rig is in place, a simple conversion process follows — energy in, scarce token out. Should the cost of production exceed the current price of the token, the miner can just choose not to sell, thereby limiting the supply of Bitcoin in circulation even more and eventually selling them for other goods whenever he sees fit. In this sense, Bitcoin is a battery. Perhaps the best battery ever invented.\n\nStoring and moving electrical energy around has always been costly and wasteful. Bitcoin offers a way of converting energy into a small part of a specific number. A mathematical battery, if you will. It is important to remember that it does not convert energy into value *directly*, but rather electricity into digital scarcity — digital scarcity that can be used to express value. Energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system, as the first law of thermodynamics clearly states. Bitcoin can express how much energy was sacrificed in order to acquire a share of the total sum. You can also acquire Bitcoin by buying it rather than mining it, but in doing so, you also spend energy. You somehow acquired the money with which you bought the Bitcoin. You, or someone else, sacrificed time and energy somewhere. Bitcoin lets you express that you see that there’s a connection between value and scarcity by letting you sacrifice effort to claim a part of the total sum.\n\nThe excitement we so-called \"Bitcoin Maximalists\" feel about Bitcoin does not come primarily from the enormous gains that those who hopped early onto the freight train have been blessed with. Nor is it because we’re “in it for the technology,” as can often be heard from opponents. Those of us who preach the near-divinity of this invention do so above all because we see the philosophical impacts of absolute scarcity in a commodity. The idea of a functioning solution to the double-spending problem in computerized money is an achievement that simply can’t be ignored. By solving the double-spending problem, Satoshi also made counterfeiting impossible, which in turn makes artificial inflation impossible. The world-changing potential of this invention cannot be understated. Not in the long run.\n\nThe more you think about it, the more the thought won’t give you any peace of mind. If this experiment works, if it’s real, it will take civilization to the next level. What we don’t know is how long this will take. Right now, debates in the Bitcoin space are about Bitcoin’s functionality as a medium of exchange and its potential as a good store of value. We might be missing the point. We cannot possibly know if a type of monetary token for which you’re completely responsible, with no third-party protection, will ever become a preferred medium of exchange for most transactions. Nor can we know if the price of Bitcoin will follow the hype-cycle path that we all want it to follow so that it can become the store of value that most maximalists claim it already is. Maybe we’ve been focused on the wrong things all along. Maybe Bitcoin’s greatest strength is in its functionality as a unit of account. After all, this is all that Bitcoin does. If you own 21 Bitcoin, you own one-millionth of the world's first absolutely scarce commodity. This might not make you rich overnight, but it just might have something to do with the opportunities available to your great-great-grandchildren.\n\nThroughout history, whenever a prehistoric human tribe invented ceremonial burial, that tribe began to expand rapidly. Why? Because as soon as you invent belief in an afterlife, you also introduce the idea of self-sacrifice on a larger scale. People who held these beliefs were much easier for a despot to manipulate and send into battle with neighboring tribes. Religious leaders can use people’s fears and superstitions to have them commit all sorts of atrocities to their fellow man, and they still do so today. Belief in a “greater good” can be the most destructive idea that can pop up in a human mind. The Nazis of World War II Germany believed that exterminating Jews was for the “greater good” of their nation’s gene pool. Belief in noble causes often comes with unintended side effects, which can have disastrous consequences.\n\nReligious leaders, political leaders, and other power-hungry sociopaths are responsible for the greatest crimes against humanity ever committed — namely, wars. Europeans often question the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms, whenever a tragic school shooting occurs on the other side of the Atlantic. What everyone seems to forget is that less than a hundred years ago, Europe was at war with itself because its citizens had given too much power to their so-called leaders. The Nazis came to power in a democracy — never forget that. Our individual rights weren’t given to us by our leaders; we were born with them. Our leaders can’t give us anything; they can only force us to behave in certain ways. If we truly want to be in charge of our lives, we need to find the tools necessary to circumvent the bullshit ourselves.\n\n### **About the Bitcoin Infinity Academy**\n\nThe Bitcoin Infinity Academy is an educational project built around [Knut Svanholm](http://primal.net/knut)’s books about Bitcoin and Austrian Economics.

My professor also said it was made for the Mexican VHS market, but I did not know he never sold it to that market.

How complex things can emerge out of simpler ones is one of those concepts. A termite colony, for instance, has a complex cooling system at its lower levels. No single termite knows how it works. Completely unaware of the end results, they build complex mounds and nests, shelter tubes to protect their paths, and networks of subterranean tunnels to connect their dirt cities. Everything seems organized and designed, but it is not. Evolution has equipped the termite with a pheromone receptor that tells the termite what task he ought to engage himself in by simply counting the number of neighboring termites doing the same thing. If there’s a surplus of workers in an area, nearby termites become warriors, and so on. Complex structures emerge from simple rules. The fractal patterns found all around nature are another example. Fractals look complex, but in reality, they’re not. They’re basically algorithms — the same pattern, repeated over and over again with a slightly modified starting point. The human brain is an excellent example of a complex thing that evolved out of simpler things, and we humans still have a hard time accepting that it wasn’t designed. Religions, which themselves are emergent systems spawned out of human interaction, have come up with a plethora of explanations for how we came to be. All sorts of wild origin stories have been more widely accepted than the simple explanation that our complexities just emerged out of simpler things following a set of rules that nature itself provided our world with.\n\nComplex systems emerge out of human interactions all the time. The phone in your pocket is the result of a century of mostly free global market competition, and no single human could ever have come up with the entire thing. The device, together with its internet connection, is capable of a lot more than the sum of its individual parts. A pocket-sized gadget that can grant instant access to almost all of the world’s literature, music, and film, which fits in your pocket, was an unthinkable science fiction a mere twenty years ago. Bitcoin, first described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper ten years before these words were written, was designed to be decentralized. Still, it wasn’t until years later that the network started to show actual proof of this. Sound money, or absolute digital scarcity, emerged out of the network not only because of its technical design. How Bitcoin’s first ten years actually unfolded played a huge part in how true decentralization could emerge, and this is also the main reason why the experiment cannot be replicated. Scarcity on the internet could only be invented once. Satoshi’s disappearance was Bitcoin’s first step towards true decentralization. No marketing whatsoever and the randomness of who hopped onto the train first were the steps that followed. Bitcoin truly had an immaculate conception.\n\nThe network has shown a remarkable resistance to change over the last few years especially, and its current state might be its last incarnation given the size of the network and the 95% agreement threshold in its consensus rules. It might never change again. In that case, an entirely new, complex life form will have emerged out of a simple set of rules. Even if small upgrades are implemented in the future, the 21 million coin supply cap is set in stone forever. Bitcoin is not for humans to have opinions about — it exists regardless of what anyone thinks about it, and it ought to be studied rather than discussed. We don’t know what true scarcity and a truly global, anonymous free market will do to our species yet, but we are about to find out. It is naïve to think otherwise. Various futurists and doomsday prophets have been focused on the dangers of the impending general artificial intelligence singularity lately, warning us about the point of no return, whereupon an artificial intelligence will be able to improve itself faster than any human could. Such a scenario could, as news anchor Ron Burgundy would have put it, escalate quickly. This may or may not be of real concern to us, but meanwhile, right under our noses, another type of unstoppable digital life has emerged, and it is already changing the behavior and preferences of millions of people around the globe. This is probably bad news for big corporations and governments but good news for the little guy looking for a little freedom. At least, that’s what those of us who lean towards the ideas of the Austrian school of economics believe. This time around, we will find out whether this is the case or not. No one knows what it will lead to and what new truths will emerge out of this new reality.\n\nUnlike the termite, we humans are able to experience the grandeur of our progress. We can look in awe at the Sistine Chapel or the pyramids, and we can delve into the technicalities and brief history of Bitcoin and discover new ways of thinking about value along the way. Money is the language in which we express value to each other through space and time. Now, that language is spoken by computers. Value expressed in this language can’t be diluted through inflation or counterfeiting any longer. It is a language that is borderless, permissionless, peer-to-peer, anonymous (if you have the skills), unreplicable, completely scarce, non-dilutable, unchangeable, untouchable, undeniable, fungible, and free for everyone on Earth to use. It is a language for the future and it emerged out of a specific set of events in the past. All languages are examples of complex systems emerging out of simpler things, and Bitcoin evolved just as organically as any other human language did.\n\nDecentralization is hard to achieve. Really hard. When it comes to claims of decentralization, a “don’t trust, verify” approach to the validity of such claims will help you filter out the noise. So, how can the validity of Bitcoin’s decentralization be verified? It’s a tricky question because decentralization is not a binary thing, like life or death, but rather a very difficult concept to define. However, the most fundamental concepts in Bitcoin, like the 21 million cap on coin issuance or the ten-minute block interval as a result of the difficulty adjustment and the Proof of Work algorithm, have not changed since very early on in the history of the network. This lack of change, which is arguably Bitcoin’s biggest strength, has been achieved through the consensus rules, which define what the blockchain is. Some special mechanisms (for example, BIP9) are sometimes used to deploy changes to the consensus rules. These mechanisms use a threshold when counting blocks that signal for a certain upgrade. For example, the upgrade “Segregated Witness” activated in a node when 95% or more of the blocks in a retarget period signaled support. Bitcoin has displayed a remarkable immutability through the years, and it is highly unlikely that this would have been the case if the game-theoretical mechanisms that enable its decentralized governance model hadn’t worked, given the many incentives to cheat that always seem to corrupt monetary systems. In other words, the longer the system seems to be working, the higher the likelihood that it actually does.\n\nSatoshi set in stone the length of the halving period — a very important aspect of Bitcoin’s issuance schedule and initial distribution. During the first four years of Bitcoin’s existence, fifty new coins were issued every ten minutes up until the first block reward halving four years later. Every four years, this reward is halved so that the issuance rate goes down by fifty percent. This effectively means that half of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist was mined during the first four years of the network’s life, one fourth during its next four years, and so on. At the time of writing, we’re a little more than a year from the third halving. After that, only 6.25 Bitcoin will be minted every ten minutes as opposed to 50, which was the initial rate. What this seems to do is to create hype cycles for Bitcoin’s adoption. Every time the price of Bitcoin booms and then busts down to a level above where it started, a hype cycle takes place. Bitcoin had no marketing whatsoever, so awareness of it had to be spread through some other mechanism. When a bull run begins, people start talking about it, which leads to even more people buying due to fear of missing out (FOMO), which inevitably causes the price to rise even more rapidly. This leads to more FOMO, and on and on the bull market goes until it suddenly ends, and the price crashes down to somewhere around, or slightly above, the level it was at before the bull run started. Unlike what is true for most other assets, Bitcoin never really crashes all the way. Why? Because every time a hype cycle occurs, some more people learn about Bitcoin’s fundamentals and manage to resist the urge to sell, even when almost all hope seems lost. They understand that these bull markets are a reoccurring thing due to the nature of the protocol. These cycles create new waves of evangelists who start promoting Bitcoin simply because of what they stand to gain from a price increase. In a sense, the protocol itself pays for its own promotion in this way. This organic marketing creates a lot of noise and confusion, too, as a lot of people who don’t seem to understand how Bitcoin works are often very outspoken about it despite their lack of knowledge. Red herrings, such as altcoins and Bitcoin forks, are then weeded out naturally during bear markets. Every time a bull market happens, a new generation of Bitcoiners is born.\n\nThe four-year period between halvings seems to serve a deliberate purpose. Satoshi could just as well have programmed a smooth issuance curve into the Bitcoin protocol, but he didn’t. As events unfold, it seems that he had good reason for this since these hype cycles provide a very effective onboarding mechanism, and they seem to be linked to the halvings. They certainly make Bitcoin volatile, but remember that in this early stage, the volatility is needed in order for these hype cycles to happen. Later on, when Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio is higher, the seas will calm, and its volatility level will go down. In truth, it already has. The latest almost 80% price drop was far from the worst we’ve seen in Bitcoin. This technology is still in its infancy, and it is very likely that we’ll see a lot more volatility before mainstream adoption, or *hyperbitcoinization,* truly happens.\n\n### **About the Bitcoin Infinity Academy**\n\nThe Bitcoin Infinity Academy is an educational project built around [Knut Svanholm](http://primal.net/knut)’s books about Bitcoin and Austrian Economics.

For more information, check out our[ Geyser page](https://geyser.fund/project/infinity)!\n\n## The Gullible Collective\n\nWe humans are biased by nature. Everything we think we know is distorted in one way or another by our cognitive shortcomings. The human brain has been forced to evolve and adapt to whatever environment it found itself in over millennia. Having a brain that is capable of setting aside personal aims for the sake of the collective has proven to be advantageous for the evolution of our species as a whole. The same is true for every other social life form. However, letting these parts of our brains guide our political judgment can lead to disastrous results in the long run — not because of bad intentions but because of the simple fact that a few individuals will always thrive by playing every political system for personal gain. From an evolutionary perspective, an army of ay-sayers and martyrs, regardless of whether we’re talking about an army of humans or an army of ants or bacteria, has an advantage over a less disciplined one. From an individual's evolutionary perspective though, it is better to  *appear* like you’re a martyr but to run and hide when the actual battle happens. This at least partly explains the high percentage of sociopaths in leadership positions all over the world. If you can appear to act for the good of the collective but dupe your way into more and more power behind people’s backs, you’re more likely to succeed than someone playing a fair game.\n\n \n\nThe story of banking and fiat currency is a story about collective madness. Historically, rulers have tricked people into killing each other through the promise of an after-life. Through central banking, the rulers of the world wars could trick people into building armies for them by printing more money. This is seldom mentioned in history classes because it still goes on today on a massive scale. Inflation might no longer be paying tank factory workers, but it is the main mechanism that funnels wealth into the pockets of the super-rich and away from everyone else. Inflation is the mechanism that hinders us from transporting the value of our labor through time. It makes us avoid real long-term thinking. We hardly ever consider this a problem because none of us has ever experienced an alternative to it.\n\nMoney is still vastly misunderstood by the lion's share of the world’s population. In most parts of the world, banks do something called fractional reserve lending. This means that they lend out money that they don't have — conjuring up new money out of thin air and handing it out to their customers as loans. Loans that have to be paid back with interest. Interest that can’t be paid back with thin air but has to be paid with so-called real money. Real money, of which there isn’t enough around to pay back all the loans, so that a constant need for new credit becomes a crucial part of the entire system. Not to mention central banks, which do the same and worse for governments. We’re so used to it by now that every country is expected to have a national debt. All but a handful of ridiculously rich ones do. National debts are also loans that have to be paid back with interest backed by nothing. Think about that. Your taxes are paying someone else's interest. Your tax money is not paying for your grandmother's bypass operation, it is paying interest to a central bank.\n\n \n\nWhen the ideas of the catholic church ruled Europe, people who didn’t believe in God were few and very seldomly outspoken. They had good reason for this since belief in God was virtually mandatory throughout society. Ever since 1971, when famously dishonest American president Richard Nixon cut the last string that tied the US Dollar to gold, our conception of what the world economy is and ought to be has been skewed by an utterly corrupt system. We’re led to believe that we’re all supposed to work longer and longer days in order to spend more and more money and bury ourselves in more and more debt to keep the machine running. We’re duped into thinking that buying a new car every other year is somehow good for the environment and that bringing a cotton bag to the grocery store will somehow save the planet. Stores manipulate us all the time through advertising and product placement, but we’re led to believe that if we can be “climate-smart,” we’re behaving responsibly. Somehow, our gross domestic product is supposed to increase indefinitely while politicians will save us from ourselves through carbon taxes. Fortunately for us, and unfortunately for them, there now exists a way for unbelievers of this narrative to opt out. Life finds a way, as Jeff Goldblum once so famously put it.\n\n \n\nCollectivism has ruined many societies. Those of us fortunate enough to live in liberal democracies tend to forget that even democracy is an involuntary system. It’s often referred to as the “worst form of government except all others that have been tried,” but the system itself is very rarely criticized. We’re so used to being governed that not having a leader seems preposterous to most of us. Still, we pay our taxes, and an enormous cut of the fruit of our labor goes to a third party via inflation and the taxation of every good and service imaginable. Institutions, once in place, tend to always favor their own survival just as much as any other living thing does. People employed in the public sector are unlikely to vote against policies that threaten their livelihood. This is a bigger problem than we realize because it’s subtle and takes a long time, but every democracy is headed in the same direction. A bigger state, a more complicated system, and fewer individual freedoms. Long term, it seems that all of our systems tend to favor those who know how to play that system and not those who contribute the most value to their fellow man. Proponents of socialist policies often claim that failed socialist states “weren’t really socialist” or that “that wasn’t really socialism.” What most people fail to realize is that we’ve never tried real *capitalism* since we’ve always used more or less inflationary currencies. This might very well be the most skewed narrative of our era. We’re all experiencing real, albeit disguised, socialism every single day. True free market capitalism is what we haven’t experienced yet, and it might turn out to be a very different thing than what we’re told to believe that it is by almost all mainstream media.\n\n \n\nThe validity of the classic right-left scale describing political viewpoints has been debated a lot lately, and alternative scales, like GAL-TAN, the one with an additional Y-axis describing more or less authoritarian tendencies, are popping up in various contexts around the web. After the birth of Bitcoin, there’s a new way to see this. Imagine an origo, a zero point, and a vector pointing to the left of that. *All* politics are arguably on the left because *all* policies need to be funded by taxes, and taxation can be viewed as theft. Taxation can be viewed as theft because, at its core, it’s involuntary. If a person refuses to pay his taxes, there is a threat of violence lurking in the background. Not to mention inflation, which Milton Friedman so elegantly described as “taxation without legislation.” What you do with the portion of your wealth that you have in Bitcoin is another matter altogether. If you take sufficient precautionary privacy measures and you know what you’re doing, your business in Bitcoin is beyond politics altogether. With the introduction of the Lightning Network and other privacy-improving features, it is now impossible for any third party to confiscate your money or even know that you have it, for that matter. This changes the political landscape of every nation on Earth. Bitcoin is much less confiscatable than gold and other scarce assets, which makes it a much better tool for hedging against nation-states. In this sense, Bitcoin obsoletes borders. You can cross any border on Earth with any amount of Bitcoin *in your head*. Think about that! Your Bitcoin exists in every country simultaneously. Any imposed limit on how much money you can carry from one nation to the other is now made obsolete by beautiful mathematics. Bitcoin is sometimes referred to as a “virtual currency.” This is a very inaccurate description. Bitcoin is just mathematics, and mathematics is just about the most real thing there is. There’s nothing virtual about it. Counterintuitive to some, but real nonetheless.\n\n \n\nThe complexity of human societal hierarchies and power structures is described perfectly in a classic children's book, *The Emperor’s New Clothes*, by Hans Christian Andersen. See the world as the kid who points out that the king is naked in the tale, and everything starts to make sense. Everything in human society is man-made. Nations, leaders, laws, political systems. They’re all castles in the air with nothing but a lurking threat of violence to back them up. Bitcoin is a different beast altogether. It enables every individual to verify the validity of the system at all times. If you really think about it, morality is easy. Don’t hurt other people, and don’t steal other people’s stuff. That’s the basic premise. Humans have but two ways of resolving conflict, conversation and violence, and in this sense, to hurt someone can only mean physical violence. This is why free speech is so important and why you should defend people’s right to speak their minds above everything else. It’s not about being able to express yourself. It’s about your right to hear every side of every argument and thus not have to resort to violence should a conflict of interests occur. You can’t limit free speech with just more speech — there’s always a threat of violence behind the limitations. Code, which both Bitcoin and the Internet are entirely made up of, *is speech*. Any limitations or regulations that your government implements in regard to Bitcoin are not only a display of Bitcoin’s censorship resistance but also a test of your government's stance on freedom of expression. A restriction on Bitcoin use is a restriction on free speech.\n\nRemember, the only alternative to speech that anyone has is violence. Code is a language, mathematics is a language, and money is a linguistic tool. A linguistic tool we use as a means of expressing value to each other and as a way to transport value through space and time. Any restrictions or regulations regarding how you can express value, for example, making it impossible to buy Bitcoin with your credit card, prove that the money you have in your bank account is not really yours. When people realize this, the demand for Bitcoin goes *up*, not down. If you know what you're doing, there’s no need to fear the regulators. They, on the other hand, have good reason to fear an invention that shamelessly breaks their spell.\n\n### **About the Bitcoin Infinity Academy**\n\nThe Bitcoin Infinity Academy is an educational project built around [Knut Svanholm](http://primal.net/knut)’s books about Bitcoin and Austrian Economics.

But few people realize how fast and easy it can be to use Bitcoin for small, everyday transactions. Enter the **Lightning Network**: a second-layer solution that enables near-instant, low-fee payments. This article will explain how it works, why it matters, and how you can use it today.\n\n**What Is the Lightning Network?**\nThe Lightning Network (LN) is a layer built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Its primary purpose is to make Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper by creating payment channels between users. Instead of recording every transaction on the main blockchain, two users can open a channel, transact as many times as they want, and settle the final balance on-chain later.\n\nThis means no long confirmation times or high fees. Payments can take less than a second and cost a fraction of a cent.\n\n**Why It Matters**\nBitcoin's main chain can process around 7 transactions per second. In contrast, Visa can handle thousands. This makes scaling Bitcoin for everyday use a challenge. Lightning changes that by handling most activity off-chain.\n\nImagine buying coffee, tipping a content creator, or paying for a digital download with Bitcoin. Lightning makes this seamless and instant. It also supports micropayments, enabling new business models like pay-per-article or per-minute streaming.\n\n**How to Start Using Lightning**\nGetting started is easier than ever:\n\n1. **Download a Lightning Wallet**: Try apps like **Wallet of Satoshi**, **Phoenix**, or **Breez**.\n2. **Get Some Sats**: Sats (short for satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin) can be received via another wallet, an exchange, or earned.\n3. **Start Spending or Zapping**: Use your Lightning wallet to pay for services, tip content creators on platforms like Nostr, or support open-source projects.\n\n**Real-World Use Cases**\n- **Nostr + Zaps**: Nostr, a decentralized social media protocol, integrates Lightning payments directly. Users can \"zap\" posts they like, sending Bitcoin instantly to the author. This has created a native reward system for content.\n- **Bitrefill**: Buy gift cards with Lightning.\n- **Podcasting 2.0**: Stream sats to podcasters per minute of audio consumed.\n\n**Citations and Resources**\n- [https://lightning.network](https://lightning.network)\n- [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-lightning-network](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-lightning-network)\n- [https://walletofsatoshi.com](https://walletofsatoshi.com)\n- [https://highlighter.com](https://highlighter.com)\n\n**Conclusion**\nBitcoin isn’t just digital gold—it’s programmable money. The Lightning Network shows how Bitcoin can work for everyday payments, from your morning coffee to rewarding your favorite content creator. If you’ve never tried it, now is the perfect time to explore this magical layer of the Bitcoin economy.\n\n**Call to Action**\nGot a Lightning wallet already? Try zapping this article on Nostr or sharing your first Lightning transaction experience!\n\n","sig":"d78afb81895baac4267b3dae154015c04dc19c2da5d3cd510123f81974022cc825130c70c07333a95b08288fc41387e2c35fb73f90e5991e8a39dc0b10fdc1ca"},"naddr1qpt4gmm094zkzunv0ykhgmedgdskcmpdferyxt2wdae8g6pd2pex2erfvd6xjmmwwvkkvmmj95erqv3494tksmedwvk4yatvd9hxwt25dp5hxt2xwfhh5etw94rxjctnvdhj6wpkdfchjdqpzemhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuurjd9kkzmpwdejhgq3qgqgpfv65dz8whvyup942daagsmwauj0d8gtxv9kpfvgxzkw4ga4sxpqqqp65wwu2pu7":{"kind":30023,"id":"bc49bd2c09e15fbecd83f504adc10ab533fc26d0735c4cb8a8cbe77a3f1d877e","pubkey":"401014b354688eebb09c096aa6f7a886ddde49ed3a166616c14b106159d5476b","created_at":1741189064,"tags":[["title","Too Early to Call: NFC North Predictions for 2025 – Who’s Ruling This Frozen Fiasco?"],["summary","Cracking the Division’s Cold Case with Records, Rumbles, and a Dash of Insanity\n"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/ce9884fe8be4bb739fec59b720f7a5ca3d7840c662aae101c96443f0ace12fbc.webp"],["t","nfl"],["t","nflstr"],["t","nostr"],["t","asknostr"],["t","vikings"],["t","packers"],["t","lions"],["t","bears"],["t","nfcnorth"],["published_at","1741189064"],["d","Too-Early-to-Call-NFC-North-Predictions-for-2025-Who-s-Ruling-This-Frozen-Fiasco-86jqy4"]],"content":"Alright, football fiends, it’s March 2025, and we’re diving into the NFC North like it’s a polar plunge with a side of cheap beer. Free agency’s a free-for-all, the draft’s a crapshoot, and this division’s always a slugfest of grit, guts, and grudges. The Vikings shocked the world with a 14-3 run in 2024, the Lions roared, the Packers stayed scrappy, and the Bears showed flashes. Let’s slap some records on this beast and figure out who’s got the stones to take the North. Here we go, fam—hold my bratwurst.\n\n###  **Minnesota Vikings: 11-6 – Darnold’s Encore or Bust**\n\n The Vikings were the NFL’s Cinderella story in 2024, rolling to 14-3 with Sam Darnold slinging it and Brian Flores’ defense eating souls. Justin Jefferson’s still a cheat code, and Aaron Jones keeps the ground game humming. That D-line—Jonathan Greenard, Andrew Van Ginkel—stays nasty, but free agency’s lurking. Danielle Hunter’s long gone, and guys like Harrison Phillips might chase a bag. J.J. McCarthy’s waiting in the wings, but Darnold’s 2024 magic earns him the nod. Regression’s real after a dream season—11-6 feels right, snagging the division. They’re not hitting 14 again, but they’re still a playoff lock. \n\n### **Detroit Lions: 10-7 – Campbell’s Grit Keeps Grinding**\n\nThe Lions were a buzzsaw in 2024, and they’re not fading. Jared Goff’s got Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams torching secondaries, while David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs bulldoze defenses. Aidan Hutchinson’s a one-man wrecking crew up front, but free agency could nick ‘em—Brian Branch or Alim McNeill might dip. Dan Campbell’s got this team playing with their hair on fire, and that O-line’s still elite. 10-7’s the call, grabbing a wildcard. They’re a hair behind Minnesota but ready to punch someone’s lights out in January.\n\n### **Green Bay Packers: 9-8 – Love’s Rollercoaster Redux** \n\nThe Packers are the NFC North’s wild card—literally. Jordan Love’s got that boom-or-bust vibe, Josh Jacobs keeps the run game honest, and the WR trio—Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed—is a problem when healthy. Rashan Gary’s a beast on D, but the secondary’s shaky, and Jaire Alexander might bolt if the money’s right. This team’s young, scrappy, and inconsistent—9-8’s where they land. Might sneak a wildcard if the chips fall, but they’re not catching the top dogs yet.\n\n### **Chicago Bears: 6-11 – Caleb’s Sophomore Slump**\n\nThe Bears had their moments in 2024, but 2025’s a grind. Caleb Williams has DJ Moore and Rome Odunze to sling it to, and D’Andre Swift’s solid, but that O-line’s still a sieve. The defense—Montez Sweat, Jaylon Johnson—can ball, but depth’s thin, and free agency might swipe Tremaine Edmunds. Williams takes a step, but not a leap—6-11’s the harsh reality.

The Vikings (11-6) snag the crown because Darnold’s 2024 glow carries over, the Lions (10-7) claw a wildcard with grit, the Packers (9-8) flirt with relevance, and the Bears (6-11) eat turf.

Free agency’s a madhouse, the draft’s a blind stab, and this division’s always a mix of fireworks and faceplants. The Bills ran the show in 2024, the Dolphins teased us, the Jets are jetting Rodgers out the door, and the Pats have a new sheriff in town. Let’s slap records on this chaos and see who’s got the cajones to take the crown. Strap in—this one’s a banger. \n\n### **Buffalo Bills: 12-5 – Josh Allen’s Reign of Pain**\n\nThe Bills owned the AFC East in 2024, and 2025’s looking like a victory lap. Josh Allen’s a goddamn force of nature—cannon arm, truck-stick legs—and he’s got James Cook tearing up the ground game even without a stud WR1. That O-line’s a top-10 crew, and the defense, despite some roster churn, still hits hard with Greg Rousseau leading the charge. Free agency might nibble at the edges—Matt Milano’s return could be clutch—but this squad’s a bully. 12-5’s the vibe, division locked up again. Good luck stopping ‘em. \n\n### **Miami Dolphins: 9-8 – Tua’s Hot-and-Cold Hustle**\n\nThe Dolphins are the AFC East’s rollercoaster—thrilling ‘til they puke. Tua Tagovailoa’s slinging to Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, but that O-line’s still a question mark, and they fold like lawn chairs in December. The defense stepped up in 2024 with Jalen Ramsey locking down receivers, but free agency could sting—Jaelan Phillips might chase a bag elsewhere. If Tua stays healthy and the core holds, 9-8’s on the table. Wildcard’s their best shot—Buffalo’s still the big brother they can’t shake. \n\n### **New York Jets: 8-9 – New QB, Same Jets Jinx**\n\nThe Jets are ditching Aaron Rodgers—old man’s outta here—and rolling with a new QB (TBD, but let’s say a rookie or a vet like Tyrod Taylor for kicks). Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall are studs, but that O-line’s a disaster, and the defense might take a hit if Sauce Gardner starts sniffing bigger paychecks. New coach, fresh start, same Jets curse? They’ve got enough talent to flirt with 8-9, maybe sniff a wildcard if the QB doesn’t totally tank. Still feels like classic Jets—almost there, never quite. \n\n### **New England Patriots: 5-12 – Vrabel’s Rough Rebuild**\n\nThe Pats are a work in progress, but Mike Vrabel’s the new head honcho, and that’s worth a damn shout. The ex-Titans tough guy’s got Drake Maye at QB—bright future, brutal present. 2025’s gonna be a grind; Maye’s taking rookie lumps behind a shaky O-line with no real weapons to speak of. Christian Gonzalez is a lockdown corner, but the defense ain’t what it was without Belichick’s wizardry. Vrabel’s a culture guy—he’ll keep ‘em scrappy—but 5-12’s the reality. They’re building, not winning, in Foxboro this year. \n\n### **The Final Buzzer**\n\nThe AFC East in 2025 is Buffalo’s playground with a dash of dysfunction. The Bills (12-5) snag the crown because Josh Allen’s a beast, the Dolphins (9-8) tease a wildcard, the Jets (8-9) stumble sans Rodgers, and the Pats (5-12) grit it out under Vrabel. That’s 34 wins, 34 losses—math’s tight when you factor in the division’s slugfest with the NFL’s other suckers. Free agency’s the X-factor—lose a star, you’re screwed; snag a gem, you’re golden. Yell at me on X when I botch this, but for now, this is my story, and I’m sticking to it. Let’s ride, degenerates.

Free agency’s a mess, the draft’s a dice roll, and we’re throwing out some ballsy calls for 2025. The Rams’ D-line was a freaking buzzsaw in 2024, Deebo Samuel ditched the Niners, and Cooper Kupp’s officially done in L.A. Let’s break this division down, team by team, with records, hot takes, and enough swagger to choke a linebacker.\n\n###  **San Francisco 49ers: 11-6 – Purdy’s Revenge Tour**\n\nThe Niners crashed and burned at 6-11 in 2024, but they’re not staying down. Brock Purdy’s still got Brandon Aiyuk and George Kittle in his pocket, even with Deebo Samuel traded to God-knows-where. That defense, with Fred Warner playing like a man possessed, is ready to wreck shop. Free agency’s a buzzkill—guys like Charvarius Ward and Talanoa Hufanga might bounce, and Javon Hargrave could get the axe for cap space. Doesn’t matter. This roster’s too stacked to suck two years running. 11-6, division champs, and a big “screw you” to the doubters. \n\n### **Los Angeles Rams: 10-7 – Stafford’s Last Stand**\n\nThe Rams ran the NFC West in 2024 with a 10-7 record, and that defensive line—Jared Verse, Kobie Turner, Braden Fiske—was straight-up nasty, turning QBs into tackling dummies all season. Matthew Stafford’s still slinging it to Puka Nacua, but Cooper Kupp’s out the door, leaving the WR room looking like a ghost town. They locked up LT Alaric Jackson with a juicy three-year deal, so the O-line’s good, and that D-line? Absolute animals—they even tied a playoff record with nine sacks in one game last year. Aaron Donald’s long gone, but these young guns don’t care. Free agents like Tutu Atwell might dip, but 10-7 and a wildcard’s on deck—Stafford’s got one more run in him. \n\n### **Arizona Cardinals: 9-8 – Kyler’s Quiet Climb**\n\nThe Cards hit 8-9 in 2024, and they’re sniffing something bigger. Kyler Murray’s locked in long-term, James Conner’s a human battering ram, and Budda Baker’s still patrolling the secondary like a hawk. Jonathan Allen’s clogging the D-line, and WRs Michael Wilson and Greg Dortch are stepping up big. Free agency could bite—Demarcus Robinson and Sean Murphy-Bunting might jet—but 9-8 feels legit. That defense held tough last year, and if Gannon keeps the vibes rolling, they’re the wildcard pain-in-the-ass nobody wants to see. \n\n### **Seattle Seahawks: 8-9 – Macdonald’s Rough Start**\n\nThe ‘Hawks rolled to 10-7 in 2024, but 2025’s got “step back” written all over it. Coach Mike Macdonald’s got Geno Smith and DK Metcalf, but free agency might gut ‘em—Ernest Jones IV, Jarran Reed, and Tyler Lockett could all walk out the door. The D-line’s got some juice with Leonard Williams, but it’s not touching the Rams’ chaos factory. Bobby Wagner’s still a stud, but he can’t carry this alone. 8-9’s the call—offense needs a jolt, and this feels like a “we’re figuring it out” season. Tough break, Seattle. \n\n### **The Final Horn**\n\nThe NFC West in 2025 is a four-way bar fight. The Niners (11-6) grab the crown with raw talent and spite, the Rams (10-7) lean on that killer D-line for a wildcard, the Cards (9-8) sneak into the mix, and the ‘Hawks (8-9) lick their wounds. That Rams front? Verse, Turner, Fiske—they’re the real deal, Donald or not, and it’s why L.A.’s still in the hunt. Free agency’s the wild card—keep your guys, you’re golden; lose ‘em, you’re cooked. Save this, share it, and come at me on X when I’m wrong. Let’s ride, fam.

Free agency’s a lawless frontier, the draft’s a roll of the dice, and this division’s always a mix of firepower and flops. The Chiefs owned 2024, the Chargers turned heads, the Broncos showed grit, and the Raiders… uh, raided their own dignity. Let’s slap some records on this rodeo and see who’s got the guts to lasso the crown. Saddle up, fam—here we go. \n\n### **Kansas City Chiefs: 12-5 – Mahomes’ Dynasty Rolls On**\n\nThe Chiefs were the AFC’s big dogs in 2024, and 2025’s no different. Patrick Mahomes is still the NFL’s cheat code—Xavier Worthy’s a speed demon, Travis Kelce’s defying Father Time, and the O-line’s a fortress. That defense—Chris Jones, Trent McDuffie—keeps QBs sweating, but free agency’s a buzzkill. The WR depth’s thin. Still, Mahomes magic lands ‘em at 12-5, division champs. KC’s the team everyone loves to hate—and they keep winning anyway. \n\n### **Los Angeles Chargers: 10-7 – Harbaugh’s Grit Pays Off** \n\nThe Chargers flipped the script in 2024 under Jim Harbaugh, and they’re building steam. Justin Herbert’s a cannon-armed freak, Ladd McConkey’s emerging, and J.K. Dobbins (if healthy) keeps the run game humming. The defense—Joey Bosa, Derwin James—is a problem when it’s clicking, but free agency looms. Khalil Mack’s getting old, and Asante Samuel Jr. might bolt. 10-7’s the vibe, snagging a wildcard. Harbaugh’s got ‘em believing—they’re legit playoff pests now. \n\n### **Denver Broncos: 8-9 – Bo Nix’s Baby Steps** \n\nThe Broncos showed fight in 2024 with rookie Bo Nix, and 2025’s a growth spurt. Nix has Courtland Sutton and Marvin Mims to sling it to, while Javonte Williams grinds the run game. That defense—Pat Surtain II, Zach Allen—is still nasty, but free agency could sting. Jonathon Cooper might cash out elsewhere, and the O-line needs juice. 8-9’s where they land—close, but not quite playoff-ready. Sean Payton’s cooking, but it’s not fully baked yet. \n\n### **Las Vegas Raiders: 4-13 – Chaos in the Desert**\n\nThe Raiders are the AFC West’s hot mess. No QB worth a damn (Aidan O’Connell? Please), Davante Adams bailed, and the run game’s a ghost town without Josh Jacobs. The defense—Maxx Crosby, Christian Wilkins—has some bite, but the roster’s a dumpster fire, and free agency won’t help. Tyree Wilson’s unproven, and the cap’s a nightmare. 4-13’s the brutal truth—they’re tanking for a draft savior. Vegas, baby, but not in a good way. \n\n### **The Final Shootout** \n\nThe AFC West in 2025 is a Chiefs cakewalk with a Charger chaser. The Chiefs (12-5) lock the title because Mahomes is Mahomes, the Chargers (10-7) snag a wildcard with Harbaugh’s mojo, the Broncos (8-9) tease progress, and the Raiders (4-13) crash and burn. Free agency’s the wild card—lose a star, you’re toast; keep ‘em, you’re riding high. Hit me on Nostr when I screw this up, but this is my AFC West sermon. Let’s roll, degenerates.

For more information, check out our[ Geyser page](https://geyser.fund/project/infinity)!\n\n## An Immaculate Conception\n\nSome concepts in nature are harder for us humans to understand than others. How complex things can emerge out of simpler ones is one of those concepts. A termite colony, for instance, has a complex cooling system at its lower levels. No single termite knows how it works. Completely unaware of the end results, they build complex mounds and nests, shelter tubes to protect their paths, and networks of subterranean tunnels to connect their dirt cities. Everything seems organized and designed, but it is not. Evolution has equipped the termite with a pheromone receptor that tells the termite what task he ought to engage himself in by simply counting the number of neighboring termites doing the same thing. If there’s a surplus of workers in an area, nearby termites become warriors, and so on. Complex structures emerge from simple rules. The fractal patterns found all around nature are another example. Fractals look complex, but in reality, they’re not. They’re basically algorithms — the same pattern, repeated over and over again with a slightly modified starting point. The human brain is an excellent example of a complex thing that evolved out of simpler things, and we humans still have a hard time accepting that it wasn’t designed. Religions, which themselves are emergent systems spawned out of human interaction, have come up with a plethora of explanations for how we came to be. All sorts of wild origin stories have been more widely accepted than the simple explanation that our complexities just emerged out of simpler things following a set of rules that nature itself provided our world with.\n\nComplex systems emerge out of human interactions all the time. The phone in your pocket is the result of a century of mostly free global market competition, and no single human could ever have come up with the entire thing. The device, together with its internet connection, is capable of a lot more than the sum of its individual parts. A pocket-sized gadget that can grant instant access to almost all of the world’s literature, music, and film, which fits in your pocket, was an unthinkable science fiction a mere twenty years ago. Bitcoin, first described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper ten years before these words were written, was designed to be decentralized. Still, it wasn’t until years later that the network started to show actual proof of this. Sound money, or absolute digital scarcity, emerged out of the network not only because of its technical design. How Bitcoin’s first ten years actually unfolded played a huge part in how true decentralization could emerge, and this is also the main reason why the experiment cannot be replicated. Scarcity on the internet could only be invented once. Satoshi’s disappearance was Bitcoin’s first step towards true decentralization. No marketing whatsoever and the randomness of who hopped onto the train first were the steps that followed. Bitcoin truly had an immaculate conception.\n\nThe network has shown a remarkable resistance to change over the last few years especially, and its current state might be its last incarnation given the size of the network and the 95% agreement threshold in its consensus rules. It might never change again. In that case, an entirely new, complex life form will have emerged out of a simple set of rules. Even if small upgrades are implemented in the future, the 21 million coin supply cap is set in stone forever. Bitcoin is not for humans to have opinions about — it exists regardless of what anyone thinks about it, and it ought to be studied rather than discussed. We don’t know what true scarcity and a truly global, anonymous free market will do to our species yet, but we are about to find out. It is naïve to think otherwise. Various futurists and doomsday prophets have been focused on the dangers of the impending general artificial intelligence singularity lately, warning us about the point of no return, whereupon an artificial intelligence will be able to improve itself faster than any human could. Such a scenario could, as news anchor Ron Burgundy would have put it, escalate quickly. This may or may not be of real concern to us, but meanwhile, right under our noses, another type of unstoppable digital life has emerged, and it is already changing the behavior and preferences of millions of people around the globe. This is probably bad news for big corporations and governments but good news for the little guy looking for a little freedom. At least, that’s what those of us who lean towards the ideas of the Austrian school of economics believe. This time around, we will find out whether this is the case or not. No one knows what it will lead to and what new truths will emerge out of this new reality.\n\nUnlike the termite, we humans are able to experience the grandeur of our progress. We can look in awe at the Sistine Chapel or the pyramids, and we can delve into the technicalities and brief history of Bitcoin and discover new ways of thinking about value along the way. Money is the language in which we express value to each other through space and time. Now, that language is spoken by computers. Value expressed in this language can’t be diluted through inflation or counterfeiting any longer. It is a language that is borderless, permissionless, peer-to-peer, anonymous (if you have the skills), unreplicable, completely scarce, non-dilutable, unchangeable, untouchable, undeniable, fungible, and free for everyone on Earth to use. It is a language for the future and it emerged out of a specific set of events in the past. All languages are examples of complex systems emerging out of simpler things, and Bitcoin evolved just as organically as any other human language did.\n\nDecentralization is hard to achieve. Really hard. When it comes to claims of decentralization, a “don’t trust, verify” approach to the validity of such claims will help you filter out the noise. So, how can the validity of Bitcoin’s decentralization be verified? It’s a tricky question because decentralization is not a binary thing, like life or death, but rather a very difficult concept to define. However, the most fundamental concepts in Bitcoin, like the 21 million cap on coin issuance or the ten-minute block interval as a result of the difficulty adjustment and the Proof of Work algorithm, have not changed since very early on in the history of the network. This lack of change, which is arguably Bitcoin’s biggest strength, has been achieved through the consensus rules, which define what the blockchain is. Some special mechanisms (for example, BIP9) are sometimes used to deploy changes to the consensus rules. These mechanisms use a threshold when counting blocks that signal for a certain upgrade. For example, the upgrade “Segregated Witness” activated in a node when 95% or more of the blocks in a retarget period signaled support. Bitcoin has displayed a remarkable immutability through the years, and it is highly unlikely that this would have been the case if the game-theoretical mechanisms that enable its decentralized governance model hadn’t worked, given the many incentives to cheat that always seem to corrupt monetary systems. In other words, the longer the system seems to be working, the higher the likelihood that it actually does.\n\nSatoshi set in stone the length of the halving period — a very important aspect of Bitcoin’s issuance schedule and initial distribution. During the first four years of Bitcoin’s existence, fifty new coins were issued every ten minutes up until the first block reward halving four years later. Every four years, this reward is halved so that the issuance rate goes down by fifty percent. This effectively means that half of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist was mined during the first four years of the network’s life, one fourth during its next four years, and so on. At the time of writing, we’re a little more than a year from the third halving. After that, only 6.25 Bitcoin will be minted every ten minutes as opposed to 50, which was the initial rate. What this seems to do is to create hype cycles for Bitcoin’s adoption. Every time the price of Bitcoin booms and then busts down to a level above where it started, a hype cycle takes place. Bitcoin had no marketing whatsoever, so awareness of it had to be spread through some other mechanism. When a bull run begins, people start talking about it, which leads to even more people buying due to fear of missing out (FOMO), which inevitably causes the price to rise even more rapidly. This leads to more FOMO, and on and on the bull market goes until it suddenly ends, and the price crashes down to somewhere around, or slightly above, the level it was at before the bull run started. Unlike what is true for most other assets, Bitcoin never really crashes all the way. Why? Because every time a hype cycle occurs, some more people learn about Bitcoin’s fundamentals and manage to resist the urge to sell, even when almost all hope seems lost. They understand that these bull markets are a reoccurring thing due to the nature of the protocol. These cycles create new waves of evangelists who start promoting Bitcoin simply because of what they stand to gain from a price increase. In a sense, the protocol itself pays for its own promotion in this way. This organic marketing creates a lot of noise and confusion, too, as a lot of people who don’t seem to understand how Bitcoin works are often very outspoken about it despite their lack of knowledge. Red herrings, such as altcoins and Bitcoin forks, are then weeded out naturally during bear markets. Every time a bull market happens, a new generation of Bitcoiners is born.\n\nThe four-year period between halvings seems to serve a deliberate purpose. Satoshi could just as well have programmed a smooth issuance curve into the Bitcoin protocol, but he didn’t. As events unfold, it seems that he had good reason for this since these hype cycles provide a very effective onboarding mechanism, and they seem to be linked to the halvings. They certainly make Bitcoin volatile, but remember that in this early stage, the volatility is needed in order for these hype cycles to happen. Later on, when Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio is higher, the seas will calm, and its volatility level will go down. In truth, it already has. The latest almost 80% price drop was far from the worst we’ve seen in Bitcoin. This technology is still in its infancy, and it is very likely that we’ll see a lot more volatility before mainstream adoption, or *hyperbitcoinization,* truly happens.\n\n### **About the Bitcoin Infinity Academy**\n\nThe Bitcoin Infinity Academy is an educational project built around [Knut Svanholm](http://primal.net/knut)’s books about Bitcoin and Austrian Economics. Each week, a whole chapter from one of the books is released for free on Highlighter, accompanied by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/@BitcoinInfinityShow) in which Knut and [Luke de Wolf](http://primal.net/luke) discuss that chapter’s ideas. You can join the discussions by signing up for one of the courses on our [Geyser](https://geyser.fund/project/infinity) page. Signed books, monthly calls, and lots of other benefits are also available.","sig":"7b136dbedc798fa0546347ce76bb33d092e0f3518fcd35abcb3b991413b02c3fad1af397753d33508de1ffe5b934d74df13146aa18372c9b6888c592ad48bdd9"},"naddr1qq08getnw35kueedva5x7um5dehhxarj945kuar9vaexzarfdahqz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzph68s45y080zdd9g8sdacnd6kcd4ejpwrgcju2eghjq45y4f28n8qvzqqqr4guymzszj":{"kind":30023,"id":"512670ba2a615d90aeda8103dbfe65b85d329bf41e5d0fa3ab33280617c7bd48","pubkey":"df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67","created_at":1745278577,"tags":[["d","testing-ghostnostr-integration"],["title","Testing Ghost/Nostr Integration"],["summary","testing the Ghost Nostr Integratinon at https://untype.app/"],["image","https://gitea.marc26z.com/marc/Marc26z/raw/commit/80ec934d7466f1fd0c314766dd298a883e66bb68/Screenshot%20from%202025-04-21%2016-32-36.png"],["published_at","1745278577"],["t","nostr"],["t","test"],["t","untupe"]],"content":"Testing \n\n[Untype.app](https://untype.app/)\n","sig":"48f3b4cee671d7b03c6017bfb141278ec99baf38cbd5661e2eb548c213d1339ee80a431c561a31e5a83a4b75c58312d7db65be968e9a919c3aea835f2ad1b23d"},"naddr1qq09g6r994pxzar5d3jj6st8v95kuum594fhqctd94hk7mnzwa3sz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzpa5rapcrtaadfazwpwvvl0v4xlskg4df9nfcem7yevcaka2h7hhjqvzqqqr4gu2tru7e":{"kind":30023,"id":"7d9d78295240910369f30b8ae0bd7279d0ba6e0a06ec59f683b1836a2bb60508","pubkey":"f683e87035f7ad4f44e0b98cfbd9537e16455a92cd38cefc4cb31db7557f5ef2","created_at":1745835055,"tags":[["title","The Battle Against Spam"],["summary","Spam is the single biggest problem in decentralized networks"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/b07c632bb3a13451e506a4ccc461ec8d15e52d1c9524e8dd519bdeef0965e1a1.jpg"],["t","wot"],["t","spam"],["t","nostr"],["t","email"],["published_at","1745835055"],["d","The-Battle-Against-Spam-oonbwc"]],"content":"Spam is the single biggest problem in decentralized networks. Jameson Lopp, co-founder of Casa and OG bitcoiner, has written a brilliant article on [the death of decentralized email](https://blog.lopp.net/death-of-decentralized-email/) that paints a vivid picture of what went wrong—and how an originally decentralized protocol was completely captured. The cause? Spam.\n\nThe same fate *may* happen to Nostr, because posting a note is fundamentally cheap. Payments, and to some extent Proof of Work, certainly have their role in fighting spam, but they introduce friction, which doesn’t work everywhere. In particular, they can’t solve every economic problem.\\\nTake free trials, for example. There is a reason why 99% of companies offer them. Sure, you waste resources on users who don’t convert, but it’s a calculated cost, a marketing expense. Also, some services can’t or don’t want to monetize directly. They offer something for free and monetize elsewhere.\n\nSo how do you offer a free trial or giveaway in a hostile decentralized network? Or even, how do you decide which notes to accept on your relay?\n\nAt first glance, these may seem like unrelated questions—but they’re not. Generally speaking, these are situations where you have a finite *budget*, and you want to use it well. You want *more* of what you value — and *less* of what you don’t (*spam*).\n\n**Reputation is a powerful shortcut when direct evaluation isn’t practical**. It’s hard to earn, easy to lose — and that’s exactly what makes it valuable.\\\nCan a reputable user do bad things? Absolutely. But it’s much less likely, and that’s the point. Heuristics are always imperfect, just like the world we live in.\n\nThe legacy Web relies heavily on email-based reputation. If you’ve ever tried to log in with a temporary email, you know what I’m talking about. It just doesn’t work anymore. The problem, as Lopp explains, is that these systems are highly centralized, opaque, and require constant manual intervention.\\\nThey also suck. They put annoying roadblocks between the world and your product, often frustrating the very users you’re trying to convert.\n\nAt Vertex, we take a different approach.\\\nWe [transparently](https://github.com/vertex-lab) analyze Nostr’s open social graph to help companies fight spam while improving the UX for their users. But we don’t take away your agency—we just do the math. You take the decision of what algorithm and criteria to use.\n\n**Think of us as a signal provider, not an authority.**\\\nYou define what reputation means for your use case. Want to rank by global influence? Local or personalized? You’re in control. We give you actionable and transparent analytics so you can build sharper filters, better user experiences, and more resilient systems. That’s how we fight spam, without sacrificing decentralization.\n\n---\n\nAre you looking to add Web of Trust capabilities to your app or project?\\\n[Take a look at our website](https://vertexlab.io/) or [send a DM to Pip](https://signal.me/#eu/O6mL1ozXhujHr-seJPkZzA4EKprDgr64AqoAOhu4U5TtKlRwutNJvbsCqXJvZb1-).","sig":"bf16e68d89479c2a4a0663dac8ad02697f556c5e23d41b69330bcebd4d25777906b06dd79ae91b8fd74ad70f40ea3816412b0023fc52ba1ed852ba8627ac0467"},"naddr1qq0xzttnd9khqmr994kxjum594hkvttwdaehgu3dwd5kwmn9wfesz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzq0pcnj8563k2syckwsaruv7wmvwsvx0cw78wwn28yethteazalmlqvzqqqr4guk9jme6":{"kind":30023,"id":"198da20e476b857d6a928d8fa4996af3f883e6573f9e7d5e5f85761f4f23b5cc","pubkey":"3c389c8f4d46ca81316743a3e33cedb1d0619f8778ee74d47265775e7a2eff7f","created_at":1745950020,"tags":[["d","a-simple-list-of-nostr-signers"],["title","A Simple List of Nostr Signers"],["summary","sorted by device"],["published_at","1745950020"],["t","nostr"]],"content":"### Extentions:\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/flamingo-%E2%80%93-nostr-extensio/alkiaengfedemppafkallgifcmkldohe\n\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nos2x/kpgefcfmnafjgpblomihpgmejjdanjjp\n\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aka-profiles/ncmflpbbagcnakkolfpcpogheckolnad\n\nhttps://keys.band/\n\nhttps://github.com/haorendashu/nowser\n\n### The Remote Signer:\nhttps://nsec.app/\n\nhttps://github.com/kind-0/nsecbunkerd\n\n### Native Android Signer:\nhttps://github.com/greenart7c3/amber\n\n### iOS\nhttps://testflight.apple.com/join/8TFMZbMs\n\nhttps://testflight.apple.com/join/DUzVMDMK\n\nHigher Security Options:\nTo start using Nostr with a secure, recoverable keypair:\nhttps://nstart.me/en\n\nFor Existing Keys:\nhttps://www.frostr.org/\n\nThank you to https://nostr.net/ for keeping a thorough list of Nostr apps, clients, and tools!","sig":"a91018a2ee2f57117f24ede23487b228c0786a2a17d7794971f6d0ef83e170d1b1a4ef3fcd7a65ad86647ad5a7772e705f01e04374f454c45ef2320f03b85f7b"},"naddr1qq24wkrwv9k42uj68ymn2wzddazkxmtwva98xqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qyg9mkhw6pc24v7te7p2rgpaacgpn6mcthvc0wfgj4xqulke0p838gupsgqqqw4rsc549u2":{"kind":30023,"id":"573fd229c79924392715cf65ddbbd9a85942c9b0917177b8cbfe6ae0693e5524","pubkey":"bbb5dda0e15567979f0543407bdc2033d6f0bbb30f72512a981cfdb2f09e2747","created_at":1742328714,"tags":[["client","Yakihonne","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["published_at","1742328714"],["d","WXnamUrZ9758MoEcmngJs"],["image","https://cdn.satellite.earth/6c41551c51cf42480b3fac54ee4e479cda015df26b7312d7ea9749872d30e535.jpeg"],["title","My week (10) in review"],["summary","Time isn't constant, or at least my perception of it isn't.

Because now anyone can be an operator, the flow will be different than on legacy git collaboration tools. We hashed out an early version of a user interface. You can check it out at [vnext.gitworkshop.dev](https://vnext.gitworkshop.dev). Go to profile icon \u003e settings \u003e experimental mode (on).\n\n### The issues we face\nWe're having some debates wether or not the workflow runners fit within the DVM spec. The main difference between this and all DVM implementations that i'm aware of. Is that most DVM are quite cookie-cutter input, processing, then answer within a few seconds. \n\n#### Costs not known up front\nThe workflow runners are long-running jobs, they can run for hours potentially, AND it's impossible to know how long a job is going to take beforehand, meaning there can be no set price per invocation. So we send a pre-payment for the maximum runtime (`price/sec` * `timeoutSec`) and expect the runner to return the change when the job is done, so we need to account for that. \n\n#### Handling cancellations\nAlso when a job is cancelled, which in the DVM spec is done by a delete request, which forms a problem because we want to keep a history of our runs, even if they're cancelled.\n\n#### DVM partial results\nWe currently use partial results to 'stream' back logs from the job. However the log output of jobs can be massive and we might not want to keep them around for long, Ephemeral would might be better suited for that and the final log output could be saved on blossom to be included in the final status.\n\n#### Queueing runs\nThe DVM spec does not specify any queuing messaging/statuses. Workflows can rely heavily on the type of machine they run on. Architecture, OS, memory or vCPU's. That means you might want to schedule jobs even though all potential runners are currently busy. Therefore a queueing system makes a lot of sense. We might be able to squeeze such a system into our implementation of the DVM spec. But it's just one of the things that makes us wonder if we're not drifting too far from the spec to still call it a DVM.\n\nSome screenshots of our implementation:\nhttps://vnext.gitworkshop.dev/arjen@swissdash.site/dvm-cicd-runner\n\n| ![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/dc30fb62c8db6e5448ed4eed5f5a07e22c30f445c4e89187830cb9ae5d038086.png) |     |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |\n| ![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/0204ee8c4227e7431ca37b26e384e4b5ba86ac73d147a04888aff1ecf087f61c.png) |     |\n|                                                                                                       |     |\n\n---\n## Infernal Insights\n![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/767d3a3dca85230800f6ca4b42831ba923f8ce34baaead5e4dbc1ca55d8ace2b.png)\nAaah... Logging and metrics, our favourite hard-to-manage infrastructure thing we don't really want to do but kind of need to make a good product.\n\nComing from the DevOps world, these systems usually can be incredibly valuable, but can be a pain to set up and/or maintain.\n\nI ended up on a fun proof-of-concept together with nostr:npub1ye5ptcxfyyxl5vjvdjar2ua3f0hynkjzpx552mu5snj3qmx5pzjscpknpr and nostr:npub15qydau2hjma6ngxkl2cyar74wzyjshvl65za5k5rl69264ar2exs5cyejr  we made this dead simple nostr message:\n\n```json\n{  \n    \"kind\": 1314,\n    \"expires\":\n    \"tags\": [\n\t    [\"expiration\", nostrNow() + oneMonth],\n\t    [\"n\" \"tollgate-site\"] // Application Namespace\n\t    [\"p, \"1096f6b...a74c7ecc\"] // pubkey of person behind current deployment\n    ],\n    \"content\": \"The button on the top-right disappears when i hover on it.\"\n}\n```\nIt basically tags the developer of the application/site and a namespace (aka: the name of the software). @hzrd created [this simple button](https://github.com/hzrd149/nostr-feedback-button) to add to a website header that creates the ability to send these events.\n\nThe `n` tag is there to give the name of the software, that way different people (npubs) can gather feedback on seperate deployments, and the developer of said software could also utilize this data for its own purposes by filtering on the `n` tag. Whereas a developer is probably only interested in their own deployment\n\nThe events are ONLY meant as raw data, like human written feedback, maybe crash logs. It can be anything and they're not meant to be kept around for long, it should be ingested by a pipeline, which can then run one or more rounds of filtering, tagging, categorizing. Each resulting in a new refined event, ingestable by the next.\n\nHowever for this experiment we stuck with ingesting it, and do just one step of refinement and send it off to a logging-aggregation system, in this case Grafana Loki. We basically sent the logs straight over there, but we also added a fun extra feature, sentiment analysis!\n\nWe sent the contents of the logs over to [ppq.ai](https://ppq.ai) and let it give us a sentiment score from 1 to 10. So we can get a sense of how positive/negative the feedback is. This same principle can be applied in so many ways. Think of categorizing by LLM. You can group feedback based on if it's about the UI for example. It'd be easy to group them and create a Nostr git issue out of those.\n\nFind my software for the dat ingestion

As we are preparing for our annual party on the third day of Christmas I’d like to reflect to all the great stuff we’ve build together to push bitcoin adoption from bottom up. I’m proud we’ve made it this far and we’re just starting! 🔥\n We like to come together as often as possible to chat about bitcoin and drink a beer so we started even more meetups. We now do meetups in Roermond, Leiden, Eindhoven, Utrecht, Breda, Friesland, Zaandam. And an occasional party in Arnhem or Den Bosch. Feel free to join us anytime.\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/a1c1984994512025327f52c7b6d3a1434a37fbb7a318380cab4832f8daacbb52/files/1735554224121-YAKIHONNES3.jpeg)\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/a1c1984994512025327f52c7b6d3a1434a37fbb7a318380cab4832f8daacbb52/files/1735554283770-YAKIHONNES3.jpeg)\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/a1c1984994512025327f52c7b6d3a1434a37fbb7a318380cab4832f8daacbb52/files/1735554300033-YAKIHONNES3.jpeg)\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/a1c1984994512025327f52c7b6d3a1434a37fbb7a318380cab4832f8daacbb52/files/1735554316412-YAKIHONNES3.jpeg)\n\n\u003e On our meetups and in the wild we meet the most awesome bitcoiners.

Nostrエクステンション（NIP-07）を導入する\n\nNostrエクステンションは使いたいカスタム絵文字を登録する時に必要になります。\n\nまた、環境（パソコン、iPhone、androidなど）によって導入方法が違います。\n\nNostrエクステンションを導入する端末は、実際にNostrを閲覧する端末と違っても構いません（リスト登録はPC、Nostr閲覧はiPhoneなど）。\n\nNostrエクステンション（NIP-07）の導入方法は以下のページを参照してください。\n\n[ログイン拡張機能 (NIP-07)を使ってみよう | Welcome to Nostr! ～ Nostrをはじめよう！ ～ ](https://welcome.nostr-jp.org/tutorial/nip-07.html)\n\n少し面倒ですが、これを導入しておくとNostr上の様々な場面で役立つのでより快適になります。\n\n## 使いたいカスタム絵文字をリストに登録する\n\n\n以下のサイトで行います。\n\n[emojito](https://emojito.meme/)\n\n右上の**Get started**からNostrエクステンションでログインしてください。        \n\n\n例として以下のカスタム絵文字を導入してみます。\n\n実際より絵文字が少なく表示されることがありますが、古い状態のデータを取得してしまっているためです。その場合はブラウザの更新ボタンを押してください。\n\n[generalJP |

Daily activity peaked at 18256 events, with a low of approximately 16087.\n\nThe number of new users has increased significantly. Profiles with a contact list are now around 393,637, a 17-fold increase. Pubkeys writing events have declined to approximately 227,635, but have still grown by 14%. Profiles with a bio are now 9 times the previous number.\n\nRegarding event publishing, the total number of note events published is about 11 million. Posts remain the most dominant in terms of volume, totaling approximately 1.7 million, reflecting an increase of 6.8%. Reposts are showing a increase of approximately 12%, while reactions have experienced a 8% decline.\n\nFor zap activity, the total zap amount is about 13 million, showing a decrease of over 22% compared to the previous period.\n\nData source: https://stats.nostr.band/\n\n\nNIPs\n---\n\n**[nip99 e-commerce use case extension](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1784)**\n\nnostr:npub1gmmrkec8een5jelrxq5rz260nqzpnj45yzznpaerqv0yma3s86gqpfe2h0  is proposing nip99 e-commerce use case extension. This pull request simply adds a link to the specification we are developing and have consensus on, allowing other developers who want to implement NIP-99 for e-commerce to discover how the major developers are approaching it. In this way, we ensure that NIP-99 remains lightweight and allows for broad use cases while also providing guidance for the e-commerce use case that is currently prevalent.\n\n**[add \"global\" relay lists](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1786)**\n\nnostr:npub180cvv07tjdrrgpa0j7j7tmnyl2yr6yr7l8j4s3evf6u64th6gkwsyjh6w6 is proposing  \"global\" relay lists that streamlines the b/c process by standardizing it across multiple apps and also by allowing these lists to be shared, so when the relays that were hardcoded (and that were, at the time of the hardcoding, known to be such public squares) get shut down then clients can automatically or manually switch to new ones.\n\n**[[NIP 53 Addendum] - Add Interactive Rooms, Meetings, and Live Presence.](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1789)**\n\nnostr:npub18pudjhdhhp2v8gxnkttt00um729nv93tuepjda2jrwn3eua5tf5s80a699 is proposing that add Interactive Rooms and Meetings, and Live presence to NIP-53. Kind 30312 (Interactive Rooms), Kind 30313 (Meetings), Kind 10312 (Room Presence). These Kinds would apply to interactive audio/video platforms such as Hivetalk version 2.0 (not public yet) and Nostr Nests.\n\n**[NIP-5E: Censorship Resistant Live Streams](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1790)**\n\n[v0l](https://github.com/v0l)  is proposing a way to distribute live video streams via Nostr. \"Live Video\" in this context implies segmented video streams like HLS or DASH. Each segment of the stream is a NIP-94 event which describes where the file can be found and its hash. \n\n**[Add birth field to NIP-24 for birth date representation](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1793)**\n\nnostr:npub12egp0pvh2f0fp6sk5nt6ncehqzkz8zsma8dl8agf8p3f98v6resqku4w26  is proposing a PR that introduces the birth field to NIP-24, allowing users to specify their birth date. The goal is to enable applications to celebrate users' birthdays and allow other users to notice and join in the celebration, enhancing social interactions.Defined the format as [day, month, year (optional)]. The year is optional to accommodate users who prefer not to disclose their age.\n\n**[NIP-05: add dynamic server recommendation](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1794)**\n\nnostr:npub1q3sle0kvfsehgsuexttt3ugjd8xdklxfwwkh559wxckmzddywnws6cd26p is  proposing NIP-05 services who let people sign up for a NIP-05 name are recommended to make the names unique case insensitive.\n\n\n**[Add delegation to nip 46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1795)**\n\n[Staab](https://github.com/staab) is proposing PR that adds a delegation command to NIP 46, which allows applications that are already authorized to create new sessions with limited permissions. My use case for this is sharing a read-only session with push- or email- notification servers, which can only sign kind 22242 events on behalf of the user, in order to get access to auth-gated relays.\n\n**[Add notifiers nip](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1796)**\n\n[Staab](https://github.com/staab) updates NIP: XXX - Push Notifiation with the following differences: It uses parameterized replaceable events, which allows for multiple subscriptions to exist at the same time；It uses NIP 44 encryption rather than NIP 04；It uses filters rather than ad-hoc targets；It uses delegated authentication in order to gain access to gated relays；It uses a different mechanism for pausing notifications and auto-expiring pauses.\n\n**[NIP-22: Format should follow scope](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1797)**\n\nnostr:npub1gcxzte5zlkncx26j68ez60fzkvtkm9e0vrwdcvsjakxf9mu9qewqlfnj5z  is proposing This adds some flexibility in formatting styles for NIP-22. Since this NIP is always used inside a scope (another NIP), formatting rules SHOULD be defined by that NIP. Examples: If the Comment is replying to a markdown-based NIP, it should allow markdown. If the Comment is replying to an asciidoc-based NIP, it should allow asciidoc.\n\n**[NIP-34!: use NIP-22 thread style for patch and status events](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1799)**\n\nnostr:npub15qydau2hjma6ngxkl2cyar74wzyjshvl65za5k5rl69264ar2exs5cyejr created this as part of reviewing #1744. For the status event, references to merged patch events are done using the q tag even though the they are not included in content. This is because NIP-22 only supports the use of e reference for the parent event id.\n\n**[NIP90: Add Ping/Pong to DVMs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1808)**\n\n[believethehype](https://github.com/believethehype) introduces kind 7007 (ping) to send a small request to a dvm to check if it is alive. The DVM replies with a kind 7000 feedback event and status pong, and optional information in content. This allows clients to test if a dvm is alive without sending an actual job request to the dvm.\n\n\nNotable Projects\n---\n **[Coracle 0.6.5 ](https://yakihonne.com/notes/nevent1qqsghht0y0x76p2mv59h9hmcrfu427d272vhst2vvzv9kps2nfh2ecczyztuwzjyxe4x2dwpgken87tna2rdlhpd02va5cvvgrrywpddnr3jyqcyqqqqqqgum092x)**\nnostr:npub1jlrs53pkdfjnts29kveljul2sm0actt6n8dxrrzqcersttvcuv3qdjynqn\n\nNew maintenance release of Coracle is out:\n* Fix memory leak\n* Fix isEventMuted\n* Fix toast animation\n* Fix (and improve) drafts\n* Fix parser dropping sections of notes\n\n**[Primal](https://yakihonne.com/notes/nevent1qqsyy4g0mw4kd54d2pyls2tj8aacxx2a0xjv6hlrejty3tw4vczhg0czyqfr47h86xrm5dkkmhxe0kl54nze4ml7yslhsfvjl78jtm2hnhesvqcyqqqqqqgnnhf92)**\nnostr:npub12vkcxr0luzwp8e673v29eqjhrr7p9vqq8asav85swaepclllj09sylpugg \n\nPrimal for iOS build 2.1.26 has just been released.

articles on Bitcoin and more than 42 related to Nostr, accounting for 26% of the total content.\n\nThese articles about Nostr mainly explore its potential as a decentralized, censorship-resistant communication protocol, contrasting it with traditional social media platforms like Facebook and X. They discuss Nostr’s ability to foster free speech, privacy, and security while providing a foundation for new applications, including encrypted messaging (such as the use of the Double Ratchet Algorithm in NIP-117 and NIP-118), decentralized identity management, and anonymous event relaying (as proposed in \"Renoters\"). Several pieces, including \"The Advancement of the Nostr Protocol,\" highlight recent technical advancements, developer tools like Nostr SDK, and practical use cases for Bitcoin applications. Others, criticize centralized platforms for their control over user data and content moderation policies. Additionally, topics like relay setup, voting systems, and AI alignment with human values are explored, emphasizing Nostr’s broader applications beyond social media.\n\nThese Bitcoin articles explore adoption, investment strategies, security, privacy, and their impact on global finance. Many highlight Bitcoin’s role in fostering financial resilience in Zimbabwe, rural economies, and the importance of user adoption over merchant adoption. Investment discussions cover DCA strategies, ETF influence, and ways to maximize returns. Privacy and security topics emphasize decentralization, self-custody, and best practices to protect assets. Bitcoin is framed as an alternative to fiat, with critiques of traditional finance and central banking. Geopolitical discussions examine the IMF’s influence, France’s fiscal crisis, and El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy. Technical innovations, such as EVM integration, Lightning Network advancements, and multi-payment solutions, continue to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem, driving broader adoption and usability.\n \nThank you, nostr:npub1m0sxqk5uwvtjhtt4yw3j0v3k6402fd35aq8832gp8kmer78atvkq9vgcru nostr:npub13rvvn5g23anm09kwnya8qvzqejxfajfa56rnn47ck5l96ke6cq4sdcd4e0 nostr:npub10m6lrv2kaf08a8um0plhj5dj6yqlw7qxzeag6393z352zrs0e5nsr2tff3 nostr:npub17v7g49shev2lwp0uwrx5v88ad6hj970zfse74wkes9jguhkx7aqsgjwsvj nostr:npub18lav8fkgt8424rxamvk8qq4xuy9n8mltjtgztv2w44hc5tt9vets0hcfsz nostr:npub1nlk894teh248w2heuu0x8z6jjg2hyxkwdc8cxgrjtm9lnamlskcsghjm9c nostr:npub1xzuej94pvqzwy0ynemeq6phct96wjpplaz9urd7y2q8ck0xxu0lqartaqn nostr:npub1g53mukxnjkcmr94fhryzkqutdz2ukq4ks0gvy5af25rgmwsl4ngq43drvk nostr:npub16dswlmzpcys0axfm8kvysclaqhl5zv20ueurrygpnnm7k9ys0d0s2v653f nostr:npub1x7zk9nfqsjwuuwm5mpdu8eevsnu2kk0ff23fv58p45d50fhuvaeszg44p2 nostr:npub1mwce4c8qa2zn9zw9f372syrc9dsnqmyy3jkcmpqkzaze0slj94dqu6nmwy and others, for your work.

Install Citrine on your Android device:\n   - Visit https://github.com/greenart7c3/Citrine/releases\n   - Download the latest release using:\n     - zap.store\n     - Obtainium\n     - F-Droid\n     - Or download the APK directly\n   - **Note:** You may need to enable \"Install from Unknown Sources\" in your Android settings\n\n2. Domain Requirements:\n   - Purchase a domain if you don't have one\n   - Transfer your domain to Cloudflare if it's not already there (for free SSL certificates and cloudflared support)\n\n3. Tools to use:\n   - nak (the nostr army knife):\n     - Download from https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak/releases\n     - Installation steps:\n       - For Linux/macOS:\n         ```bash\n         # Download the appropriate version for your system\n         wget https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak/releases/latest/download/nak-linux-amd64  # for Linux\n         # or\n         wget https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak/releases/latest/download/nak-darwin-amd64  # for macOS\n         \n         # Make it executable\n         chmod +x nak-*\n         \n         # Move to a directory in your PATH\n         sudo mv nak-* /usr/local/bin/nak\n         ```\n       - For Windows:\n         ```batch\n         # Download the Windows version\n         curl -L -o nak.exe https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak/releases/latest/download/nak-windows-amd64.exe\n         \n         # Move to a directory in your PATH (e.g., C:\\Windows)\n         move nak.exe C:\\Windows\\nak.exe\n         ```\n     - Verify installation:\n       ```bash\n       nak --version\n       ```\n\n## Setting Up Citrine\n1. Open the Citrine app\n2. Start the server\n3. You'll see it running on `ws://127.0.0.1:4869` (local network only)\n4. Go to settings and paste your npub into \"Accept events signed by\" inbox and press the + button. This prevents others from publishing events to your personal relay.\n\n## Installing Required Tools\n1. Install Termux from Google Play Store\n2. Open Termux and run:\n\n```bash\npkg update \u0026\u0026 pkg install wget\nwget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-arm64.deb\ndpkg -i cloudflared-linux-arm64.deb\n```\n\n## Cloudflare Authentication\n1. Run the authentication command:\n```bash\ncloudflared tunnel login\n```\n2. Follow the instructions:\n   - Copy the provided URL to your browser\n   - Log in to your Cloudflare account\n   - If the URL expires, copy it again after logging in\n\n## Creating the Tunnel\n1. Create a new tunnel:\n```bash\ncloudflared tunnel create \u003cTUNNEL_NAME\u003e\n```\n   - Choose any name you prefer for your tunnel\n   - Copy the tunnel ID after creating the tunnel\n\n2. Create and configure the tunnel config:\n```bash\ntouch ~/.cloudflared/config.yml\nnano ~/.cloudflared/config.yml\n```\n\n3. Add this configuration (replace the placeholders with your values):\n```yaml\ntunnel: \u003cTUNNEL_UUID\u003e\ncredentials-file: /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.cloudflared/\u003cTUNNEL_UUID\u003e.json\ningress:\n  - hostname: nostr.yourdomain.com\n    service: ws://localhost:4869\n  - service: http_status:404\n```\n   - **Note:** In nano editor:\n     - `CTRL+O` and Enter to save\n     - `CTRL+X` to exit\n   - **Note:** Check the credentials file path in the logs\n\n4. Validate your configuration:\n```bash\ncloudflared tunnel validate\n```\n\n5. Start the tunnel:\n```bash\ncloudflared tunnel run my-relay\n```\n\n## Preventing Android from Killing the Tunnel\nRun these commands to maintain tunnel stability:\n```bash\ndate \u0026\u0026 apt install termux-tools \u0026\u0026 termux-setup-storage \u0026\u0026 termux-wake-lock\necho \"nameserver 1.1.1.1\" \u003e $PREFIX/etc/resolv.conf\n```\n\n**Tip:** You can open multiple Termux sessions by swiping from the left edge of the screen while keeping your tunnel process running.\n\n## Updating Your Outbox Model Relays\n\nOnce your relay is running and accessible via your domain, you'll want to update your relay list in the Nostr network. This ensures other clients know about your relay and can connect to it.\n\n### Decoding npub (Public Key)\n\nPrivate keys (nsec) and public keys (npub) are encoded in bech32 format, which includes:\n- A prefix (like nsec1, npub1 etc.)\n- The encoded data\n- A checksum\n\nThis format makes keys:\n- Easy to distinguish\n- Hard to copy incorrectly\n\nHowever, most tools require these keys in hexadecimal (hex) format.\n\nTo decode an npub string to its hex format:\n\n```bash\nnak decode nostr:npub1dejts0qlva8mqzjlrxqkc2tmvs2t7elszky5upxaf3jha9qs9m5q605uc4\n```\n\nChange it with your own npub.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"pubkey\": \"6e64b83c1f674fb00a5f19816c297b6414bf67f015894e04dd4c657e94102ee8\"\n}\n```\n\nCopy the pubkey value in quotes.\n\n### Create a kind 10002 event with your relay list:\n\n- Include your new relay with write permissions\n- Include other relays you want to read from and write to, omit 3rd parameter to make it both read and write\n\nExample format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": 10002,\n  \"tags\": [\n    [\"r\", \"wss://your-relay-domain.com\", \"write\"],\n    [\"r\", \"wss://eden.nostr.land/\"],\n    [\"r\", \"wss://nos.lol/\"],\n    [\"r\", \"wss://nostr.bitcoiner.social/\"],\n    [\"r\", \"wss://nostr.mom/\"],\n    [\"r\", \"wss://relay.primal.net/\"],\n    [\"r\", \"wss://nostr.wine/\", \"read\"],\n    [\"r\", \"wss://relay.damus.io/\"],\n    [\"r\", \"wss://relay.nostr.band/\"],\n    [\"r\", \"wss://relay.snort.social/\"]\n  ],\n  \"content\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nSave it to a file called `event.json`\n\n**Note:** Add or remove any relays you want. To check your existing 10002 relays:\n  - Visit https://nostr.band/?q=by%3Anpub1dejts0qlva8mqzjlrxqkc2tmvs2t7elszky5upxaf3jha9qs9m5q605uc4+++kind%3A10002\n  - nostr.band is an indexing service, it probably has your relay list.\n  - Replace `npub1xxx` in the URL with your own npub\n  - Click \"VIEW JSON\" from the menu to see the raw event\n  - Or use the `nak` tool if you know the relays\n    ```bash\n    nak req -k 10002 -a \u003cyour-pubkey\u003e wss://relay1.com wss://relay2.com\n    ```\n\n    Replace `\u003cyour-pubkey\u003e` with your public key in hex format (you can get it using `nak decode \u003cyour-npub\u003e`)\n\n2. Sign and publish the event:\n   - Use a Nostr client that supports kind 10002 events\n   - Or use the `nak` command-line tool:\n   ```bash\n   nak event --sec ncryptsec1... wss://relay1.com wss://relay2.com $(cat event.json)\n   ```\n\n**Important Security Notes:**\n1. Never share your nsec (private key) with anyone\n2. Consider using NIP-49 encrypted keys for better security\n3. Never paste your nsec or private key into the terminal. The command will be saved in your shell history, exposing your private key. To clear the command history:\n   - For bash: use `history -c`\n   - For zsh: use `fc -W` to write history to file, then `fc -p` to read it back\n   - Or manually edit your shell history file (e.g., `~/.zsh_history` or `~/.bash_history`)\n4. if you're using `zsh`, use `fc -p` to prevent the next command from being saved to history\n5. Or temporarily disable history before running sensitive commands:\n\n```bash\nunset HISTFILE\nnak key encrypt ...\nset HISTFILE\n```\n\n## How to securely create NIP-49 encypted private key\n\n```bash\n# Read your private key (input will be hidden)\nread -s SECRET \n# Read your password (input will be hidden)\nread -s PASSWORD\n# encrypt command\necho \"$SECRET\" | nak key encrypt \"$PASSWORD\"\n# copy and paste the ncryptsec1 text from the output\nread -s ENCRYPTED\nnak key decrypt \"$ENCRYPTED\"\n# clear variables from memory\nunset SECRET PASSWORD ENCRYPTED\n```\n\nOn a Windows command line, to read from stdin and use the variables in `nak` commands, you can use a combination of `set /p` to read input and then use those variables in your command. Here's an example:\n\n```bash\n@echo off\nset /p \"SECRET=Enter your secret key: \"\nset /p \"PASSWORD=Enter your password: \"\n\necho %SECRET%| nak key encrypt %PASSWORD%\n\n:: Clear the sensitive variables\nset \"SECRET=\"\nset \"PASSWORD=\"\n```\n\nIf your key starts with `ncryptsec1`, the `nak` tool will securely prompt you for a password when using the `--sec` parameter, unless the command is used with a pipe `\u003c \u003e` or `|`. \n\n```bash\nnak event --sec ncryptsec1... wss://relay1.com wss://relay2.com $(cat event.json)\n```\n\n3. Verify the event was published:\n   - Check if your relay list is visible on other relays\n   - Use the `nak` tool to fetch your kind 10002 events:\n```bash\nnak req -k 10002 -a \u003cyour-pubkey\u003e wss://relay1.com wss://relay2.com\n```\n\n4. Testing your relay:\n   - Try connecting to your relay using different Nostr clients\n   - Verify you can both read from and write to your relay\n   - Check if events are being properly stored and retrieved\n   - **Tip:** Use multiple Nostr clients to test different aspects of your relay\n\n**Note:** If anyone in the community has a more efficient method of doing things like updating outbox relays, please share your insights in the comments. Your expertise would be greatly appreciated!\n","sig":"abd9291f7bc17a6d396b33f5a5f8f2dd7e8c6c1fe81b41ef7c28b2132c0af012e2686e453304e78f8d9875b34dd4d6257e475b7debfd39af983cff578144a21c"},"naddr1qq2k746jdsuxsdttva6rsnj4feeyg4nkwet45qgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qyg8nx2zjzl5hdtvu4uz5v3z6mqg8mwv0vkt8eh8xenj9ucx6qrhr9gpsgqqqw4rs5kpzfy":{"kind":30023,"id":"ae6db5da4a7a72be0e1b320eb94ca68344d5ba1b45849fb12277a8946b7d8806","pubkey":"f33285217e976ad9caf0546445ad8107db98f65967cdce6cce45e60da00ee32a","created_at":1743929914,"tags":[["client","Yakihonne","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["published_at","1743929465"],["d","oWRl8h5kgt8NUNrDVvvWZ"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/cb11d2a715f83e15e60839dde3ffff7d79043c509cf2dccda05878d981e687a1.jpg"],["title","Nostr: Resisting Social Media Censorship"],["summary","Notes from the Inaugural Muslim Bitcoin Summit Nostr Workshop."],["zap","f33285217e976ad9caf0546445ad8107db98f65967cdce6cce45e60da00ee32a","","100"],["t","nostr"],["t","muslim"]],"content":"*Notes from the Inaugural Muslim Bitcoin Summit Nostr Workshop.*\n\n04.06.25\nDallas, TX\n\n\n# What is Nostr?\n\n\u003e “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” ~ fiatjaf\n\nNostr is an open protocol that is a censorship-resistant, global \"social\" network. It doesn't rely on any trusted central server (has resilient decentralization), and is based on cryptographic keys and signatures (so it is tamperproof).\n\nThe initial description of the idea can be found at https://fiatjaf.com/nostr.html. \n\n## Digital Sovereignty\n\n\u003e “The first step towards establishing any type of Digital Sovereignty is to consider migration away from infrastructure and networks that are saturated with malevolent surveillance… there must be a simple recognition that anything sustainable from an Islamic perspective cannot be built on the platforms of Meta, Google or Amazon.” ~ [Ibn Maghreb](https://theiqrafiles.com/notes-on-digital-sovereignty/)\n\nPalestine has become the litmus test for censorship in social media:\n\n- X (formerly Twitter) - [Musk openly supports Zionism](https://english.almayadeen.net/articles/opinion/how-elon-musk-became-zionist--from-free-speech-absolutist-to)\n- Meta (FB, IG, WhatsApp) - [Project Lavender](https://blog.paulbiggar.com/meta-and-lavender/)\n- Google (YouTube) - [Project Nimbus](https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/google-firings-gaza-project-nimbus/)\n- Microsoft (LI) - [BDS “No Azure for Apartheid” campaign](https://www.bdsmovement.net/microsoft)\n\nThese are just a few examples of the barrier for a muslim narrative in fiat social media. To build unstoppable resistance we must move away from the platform and address the issue at the protocol level. \n\n## Nostr Protocol Explained\n\n1. **Relays:** Backend servers that store and broadcast data. Anyone can run one. Currently over 1k relays across over 50 countries. \u2028\n2. **Clients:** \u2028\u2028Platforms built for graphical user interface with Nostr. Anyone can build these and most are interoperable. \u2028\n3. **Key Cryptography:** User public and private keys.\n\n![image](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f21d75f62e8e8b4f5b76fd36488f7f3ca565d32a898b89d04f51d2279ec0004d/68747470733a2f2f7468652d6e6f7374722e6f72672f6469616772616d2e6a7067)\n\n*Simple video explaination: [Nostr in less than 10 minutes!](https://youtu.be/Q6f6bdKWqF8)*\n\n### Nostr's Key Features:\n\n- No Ownership - No CEO, board of directors, foundation, etc.\n- No Ads, No Big Data Collection - Users are not a product.\n- No Algorithms - Less drama, less depressing content. \n- Uncensorability - Not your keys, not your posts.\n- SEO - clean ```dofollow``` links for “Google Juice”.\n- Zaps! - BTC/Lightning integration.\n\n\u003e “This is really really important in the age of AI where in a few years you are not going to know the difference between something that is real and something that is fake. We need technologies that you can actually sign and you have the authenticity to do so, and only you, to do that.” ~ [Jack Dorsey](https://youtu.be/0YDj1QdL2Zs)\n\n## Getting Started On Nostr\u2028\u2028\n\n### Nostr 101: **[A Beginners Guide To Nostr](https://mslmdvlpmnt.com/a-beginners-guide-to-nostr-2025/)**\n\n**Top Recommended Client:** [Yakihonne](https://yakihonne.com/)\n\n*Other popular options: \n(web) [Nostrudel](https://nostrudel.ninja/)\n(iOS) [Damus](https://damus.io/)\n(Android) [Amethyst](https://www.amethyst.social/)*\n\n**Top Recommended Wallet:** [Coinos](https://coinos.io/)\n\n*Other popular options: \n[Primal Wallet](https://primal.net/home)\n[AlbyHub](https://albyhub.com/)\n[Zeus](https://zeusln.com/)\u2028(pending NWC integration)*\n\n\n### Highlights From The Nostr Ecosystem:\n\nOther Clients: \n[Olas](https://olas.app/) (photos) \n[Habla](https://habla.news/) (blogging) \n[Zap.Stream](https://zap.stream/) (video)\n\nChat: \n[0xchat](https://0xchat.com/#/)\n[KeyChat](https://www.keychat.io/)\n[Flotilla](https://flotilla.social/)\n\nShopping: \n[Plebeian Market](https://plebeian.market/)\n[Shopstr](https://shopstr.store/)\n\nPodcasting 2.0: \n[Fountain](https://fountain.fm/)\n[Wavlake](https://wavlake.com/)\n\nWorkspace Tools: \n[Listr](https://listr.lol/)\n[Formstr](https://formstr.app/#/dashboard)\n[Docstr](https://docstr.app/)\n[Nostr.Build](https://nostr.build/)\n\nSigners: \n[Nos2X](https://nostrapps.com/nos2x)\n[Nsec.app](https://nsec.app/)\n\n## Footnote\n\n[Find Muslims on Nostr](https://listr.lol/npub175nul9cvufswwsnpy99lvyhg7ad9nkccxhkhusznxfkr7e0zxthql9g6w0/30000/naddr1qq4xc6tnw3ez6efkxcun2cfkxqknzc348ykngcfnxvknsepsxukkxd33vc6x2vejv9jkgdqpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mqpzemhxue69uhhyetvv9ujumn0wd68ytnzv9hxgqg5waehxw309aex2mrp0yhxgctdw4eju6t0qgs02f70juxwyc88gfsjzjlkzt50wkjemvvrtmt7gpfnymplvh3r9msrqsqqqafsqfgqku) | [#staySAIF](https://saif.systems/articles/spiritual-opsec-guide)\n","sig":"59e5cc190c6ec00f5698b0da8e21b80493c42564719be8376c344ae7a819d36631cda78a3d0af53f2dabf0b1dae6564c6195ed783adffc2305bfbaf8502ff8e2"},"naddr1qq2kvnt0wamhqsm8fvm5wanpfd99y6nywv68zqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qygr4s6w04395zveu9gkuasewp0x0dkpacjjdl9wm0fxr6zfhdqvesupsgqqqw4rsj6xylx":{"kind":30023,"id":"45138a2bd7ea763dd5a2790c38eb700b636c03cfc3b696c46d60dcb28ede342d","pubkey":"75869cfac4b41333c2a2dcec32e0bccf6d83dc4a4df95db7a4c3d09376819987","created_at":1744733577,"tags":[["client","YakiHonne","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["d","fMowwpCgK7GvaKJRjds4q"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/9909b96ababec3fe7b5ce4c5411463b41f5a849f6f8f3ed3e00e04b9fa9c4532.jpg"],["title","Nostr Biweekly Review ( 31 Mar-13 April 2025)"],["summary","In the past two weeks, Nostr statistics indicate over 212,000 daily trusted pubkey events.

It avoids confusion for implementers and enforces consistency across clients.\n\n[**Add guidelines tag to NIP-29 group metadata #1873**]( https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1873)\n\nnostr:npub16zsllwrkrwt5emz2805vhjewj6nsjrw0ge0latyrn2jv5gxf5k0q5l92l7 adds another tag to the group metadata to include community guidelines or rules for participating in the group. The research has shown that communicating social norms is an essential component of a healthy community, so it deserves to be included as an example in the NIP here, not as a required tag necessarily, but as a standard field that we hope will be adopted by other NIP-29 clients.\n\n**[Add Diff and Permalink kinds #1875]( https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1875)**\n\nnostr:npub1ehhfg09mr8z34wz85ek46a6rww4f7c7jsujxhdvmpqnl5hnrwsqq2szjqv  is proposing a  NIP that introduces two new kinds of git events, intended to be drop-in replacements for GitHub permalinks and diff links respectively. The purpose of these kinds is to enable conversations and comments about specific lines of code, either in a given commit or the diff of two commits. These kinds are distinct from the code snippet introduced in NIP-C0 as the content of the events are not intended to be executable rather to directly reference code or documentation in a Git repo precisely and immutably.\n\n## Notable Projects\n **[Primal]( https://yakihonne.com/notes/nevent1qqsz6fjwdcrhqpvrtgrvy8p4uphyc5sr6fs0uc0mul3asg4hv7u0gaqzyqfr47h86xrm5dkkmhxe0kl54nze4ml7yslhsfvjl78jtm2hnhesvqcyqqqqqqg83k046)**\nnostr:npub12vkcxr0luzwp8e673v29eqjhrr7p9vqq8asav85swaepclllj09sylpugg\n\nThe update is now live on the App Store，the version 2.1.49 is bringing several improvements and fixes:\n* Support for animated GIF uploads\n* Resolved issues with zap.stream URLs\n* Improved deep linking to threads\n* Fixed rendering of mentioned events with unknown kinds\n\n **[YakiHonne  ]( https://yakihonne.com/notes/note10fgnugyz4t07u7t0tekqp6mnwcjvmdgk6tqzwnary069hngesw7srswkzy)**\nnostr:npub1yzvxlwp7wawed5vgefwfmugvumtp8c8t0etk3g8sky4n0ndvyxesnxrf8q\n\n* Redefine social \u0026 on-chain consumption with seamless payments, voting, and gaming — all within your feed.\n* Build Mini Apps easily with 3 creation modes \u0026 reach 170+ countries .

They also delve into the double-edged nature of anonymity, influence, and content moderation challenges within the Nostr ecosystem. On the technical side, updates such as NIP-19 support in Nostr-PHP and tools like the Blossom Uploader for enhanced media sharing are introduced. Some articles focus on practical guidance—like how to manage multiple Nostr profiles and wallets—while others emphasize creative and cultural aspects, calling for more bold, Nostr-native art. Additionally, there is ongoing exploration of Nostr’s potential in business applications and experimental features such as atomic signature swaps.\n\nThese articles about Bitcoin discuss a broad and continuously evolving ecosystem. They focus on major developments such as the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, the growing mainstream and institutional adoption driven by Bitcoin ETFs, and El Salvador’s bold “Bitcoin experiment,” questioning whether it is an economic breakthrough or a cautionary tale. The articles also delve into the mechanics of Bitcoin transaction fees, real-world experiences with the Lightning Network, and how DePIN enables individuals to turn everyday devices into income-generating tools—bringing decentralized living closer to reality.In addition, some articles revisit key historical moments in Bitcoin’s journey, such as the 2014 MIT giveaway of free Bitcoin and cultural milestones like the Bitcoin Film Festival, emphasizing the importance of storytelling in sustaining Bitcoin’s long-term vision.  \n\nThank you, nostr:npub186a9aaqmyp436j0gkxl8yswhat2ampahxunpmfjv80qwyaglywhqswhd06,  nostr:npub1uv0gf390d6592qmwyx3r232ehfvve0jamvg3jlpcjrg2qaam40qqk2dznr,  \nnostr:npub1dryseu6yv7evgz2f7pfzk6wht8flapcfv5l6r4y65pg5px293awqlwwfpc, \nnostr:npub1mgvwnpsqgrem7jfcwm7pdvdfz2h95mm04r23t8pau2uzxwsdnpgs0gpdjc, \nnostr:npub1nar4a3vv59qkzdlskcgxrctkw9f0ekjgqaxn8vd0y82f9kdve9rqwjcurn, \nnostr:npub1l5r02s4udsr28xypsyx7j9lxchf80ha4z6y6269d0da9frtd2nxsvum9jm, \nnostr:npub186k25a5rymtae6q0dmsh4ksen04706eurfst8xc5uzjchwkxdljqe59hv0, nostr:npub1x7zk9nfqsjwuuwm5mpdu8eevsnu2kk0ff23fv58p45d50fhuvaeszg44p2, nostr:npub17eygccj7l9nmpnef042d09m37x33xvvmlkf4l5ur0fwt0jff9xws2guuk6, \nnostr:npub12ffylwm93rg03fekwl7nuncvalpqflf3pazeh3kywm3rmtjqyhwqhf3tsl, nostr:npub1fn4afafnasdqcm7hnxtn26s2ye3v3g2h2xave7tcce6s7zkra52sh7yg99, \nand others, for your work.

Manuals explain the _backstitch_ or _sashiko_, but fabric _never lies_: it tears if the tension is weak, and wrinkles if the needle is clumsy.\n\nTheory gives you the alphabet; but practice gives you the syntax of the invisible. How many broken stitches hide behind perfect embroidery? How many mistakes teach us the language of threads?\n\n---\n\n### **I. TO MEND IS TO RESIST: THE POLITICAL ACT OF THE NEEDLE**\n\nThere’s a certain sacred stubbornness in sitting down to mend; like our grandmothers darning our socks until the heel was more patch than original fabric. \n\nAnd today, in the age of fast fashion, **mending is rebellion**: a silent \"no\" to disposability, a resounding \"yes\" to permanence.\n#### **Techniques as Philosophies**\n\n- **Japanese sashiko**: Visible stitches like proud scars. _\"What’s broken isn’t hidden—it’s celebrated.\"_\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/ba36d0f7e12ac51f32e5b18d52a7740ffd47698ecd9433bc6a799505cd802cba/files/1745170266563-YAKIHONNES3.jpeg)\n    \n- **Darning**: For when pain must be concealed, not erased.\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/ba36d0f7e12ac51f32e5b18d52a7740ffd47698ecd9433bc6a799505cd802cba/files/1745170297406-YAKIHONNES3.jpeg)\n    \n- **Free embroidery**: Where repair becomes art and mending, a language.\n    \n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/ba36d0f7e12ac51f32e5b18d52a7740ffd47698ecd9433bc6a799505cd802cba/files/1745170761623-YAKIHONNES3.jpeg)\n\n![image](https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/ba36d0f7e12ac51f32e5b18d52a7740ffd47698ecd9433bc6a799505cd802cba/files/1745171837603-YAKIHONNES3.jpeg)Every stitch is a pact: _\"I care for you because you exist.\"_\n\n  \nAnd isn’t this, too, what _mestizaje_ means? **To take the fragmented - fabrics, histories, identities - and reweave them without erasing their origin**. \n\n---\n\n### **II. EMBROIDERY AS A SELF-TAUGHT MASTER**\n\nLearning to embroider is like learning to live: there are no shortcuts. You can read a thousand tutorials, but until you feel the thread resist the needle’s eye or the fabric tense beneath your fingers, knowledge remains abstract.\n\n#### **The Textile Learning Triad**\n\n1. **Theory that fades** (books explain the _backstitch_, but not how to avoid knots).\n    \n2. **Practice that stings** (fingers get pricked, stitches go crooked).\n    \n3. **Intuition that blooms** (when hands _remember_ the motion on their own).\n    \n\n---\n\n### **III. THREADS AND TECHNOLOGY**\n\nMalinche, Mesoamerica’s first translator, understood this: some knowledge only transmits through action. We, as 21st-century beings, have a privilege: **to blend ancestral tools (needles, threads) with modern ones (YouTube tutorials, digital patterns)**.\n\nAt **soma**, we explore education beyond canons, and embroidery is the perfect example.\n\nEmbroidery teaches us:\n\n- **Discipline** (because one loose stitch ruins the design).\n    \n- **Creativity** (because sometimes you must invent solutions).\n    \n- **Legacy** (because every thread carries memory).\n    \n\n_What are you mending today? A skirt, a habit, a way of learning?_\n\n_This is the future of education: **to dig into the old and hack the new**_. \n\n******************\n### **IV.

We’ll create a **collective learning ritual**:\n\n- Bring a torn garment and an empty notebook.\n    \n- Learn sashiko mending (to honor scars) and bookbinding with recycled paper (to chart your path).\n    \n- **You’ll leave with ink-stained hands and a heart full of threads**.\n    \n\n_\"Perfection isn’t the goal - persistence is.\"_\n\n****************************************\n\nFollow us on IG to check out stories \u0026 upcoming events: \n@larutasoma\n@estudiomalinche\n\n#soma #article #mending #workshop #visiblemending #philosophy #resistance #btc #nostr #elsalvador #sashiko #rutadelasflores #apaneca #education #slowfashion #fashion #fastfashion #embroidery #stitching #handmade #diy","sig":"81d72d8ea47d01b61356edafa1ef8498d3f53cc99cf8daa669982e3999856c89f65560c0459ebb25f5c29adeda7904de3f85366ee14c9762b9a3c27567a4666e"},"naddr1qq2n26p5day4gnpnf469xuzr2f35cdfn2gmh5qgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qyg9xpeu7pmdd2yqdw4pmv609z0dursshp68fka8ahr5hrt73urngzvpsgqqqw4rspr5u4k":{"kind":30023,"id":"e252a8ea575eaf69c0ccaaeccaaea6953f6854c680454f3bdd0f4d7e37c0b899","pubkey":"a60e79e0edad5100d7543b669e513dbc1c2170e8e9b74fdb8e971afd1e0e6813","created_at":1743151655,"tags":[["client","Yakihonne","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["published_at","1743151655"],["d","5h4oITL3MtSpCRcL53R7z"],["image","https://hellonostr.xyz/images/otherstuffhero.png"],["title","What is the 'Other Stuff'?"],["summary","Nostr isn’t just a Twitter replacement.

But the full name, \"Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays\", gives a clue that there’s more to it than just posting short messages. The 'notes' part is easy to grasp because it forms almost everyone's first touch point with the protocol. But the 'other stuff'? That’s where Nostr really gets exciting. The 'other stuff' is all the creative and experimental things people are building on Nostr, beyond simple text based notes. \n\nEvery action on Nostr is an event, a like, a post, a profile update, or even a payment. The 'Kind' is what specifies the purpose of each event. Kinds are the building blocks of how information is categorized and processed on the network, and the most popular become part of higher lever specification guidelines known as [Nostr Implementation Possibility - NIP](https://nostr-nips.com/). A NIP is a document that defines how something in Nostr should work, including the rules, standards, or features. NIPs define the type of 'other stuff' that be published and displayed by different styles of client to meet different purposes.\n\n\n\n\u003e Nostr isn’t locked into a single purpose. It’s a foundation for whatever 'other stuff' you can dream up.\n\u003e\n\n# Types of Other Stuff\n\nThe 'other stuff' name is intentionally vague. Why? Because the possibilities of what can fall under this category are quite literally limitless. In the short time since Nostr's inception, the number of sub-categories that have been built on top of the Nostr's open protocol is mind bending. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Long-Form Content: Think blog posts or articles. [NIP-23](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-23).\n2. Private Messaging: Encrypted chats between users. [NIP-04](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-04).\n3. Communities: Group chats or forums like Reddit. [NIP-72](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-72)\n4. Marketplaces: People listing stuff for sale, payable with zaps. [NIP-15](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-15)\n5.

Let's get into it:**\n\n## TollGate App\nFor starters, we worked hard to get an early version of the [TollGate](https://tollgate.me) website live. What do we want to communicate about the project, and to whom. We've identified three 'types' of visitor, each requiring its own 'customer journey' through the website. First there's the end-user, someone that just wants access to tollgate, but doesn't care about any of the technichalities. We try to guide those people to downloading our app as soon as possible. Currently that means downloading it straight from the website as an APK file. But we want to quickly move on to publishing it to the [ZapStore](https://zapstore.dev). \n\nThe past couple weeks I put some efforts into getting the app stable. It was hard to identify what was causing the seemingly random crashes and full reloads (of the web content). After getting some outside help we've identified that we were trying to interact with the android API's on the main thread. Which is bad practice. I first couldn't figure out how to make a web request without having to spawn a seperate thread in the kotlin code, that then we'd have to create some kind of system to bubble up the callback method's result. I then found there's a proper [Tauri (the framework) way](https://tauri.app/develop/plugins/develop-mobile/) of doing this using Kotlin Coroutines, which I wasn't familliar with. But it just executes the entire Tauri 'command' (function call) on a background thread. Problem solved. I haven't had any full app crashes since.\n\nWhich left me with the random page refreshes, the thing that was behind the demo-effect at Sat's and Facts. I noticed it happened around the moments I would go to settings to hit the 'sign in' button to dismiss the captive portal. That's where I had looked before, but I needed to zoom out. It had to do SOMETHING with moving the app to and from the background. Okay is it some kind of sleep issue? I don't remember where or how I found it but I saw a suggestion to run the Tauri dev build with a --no-watch flag. Which disables hot reloading of the app when I edit one of the TypeScript/HTML files. Somehow the reload would be triggered sometimes on app switching. Why? I don't know, but i'm glad I could pinpoint it.\n\nSo now the demo part seems stable, finally. Which means I can move on and properly implement the wallet logic and making the download on the website work.\n\n## TollGateOS\n![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/384f994a7a8399bb65cd3bbcbef6dc15557259ebbd5958e9e83f236e5ffb1e04.png)\nThe second customer group will be people interested in running a TollGate. We're trying to get them to download our custom build of OpenWRT that includes all the required packages. We 'baptized' this version to be called **TollGateOS** as we say in proper Dutch ;). I think it will help to have these clear distinct names. I really want any moderately technical person to be able to install TollGateOS on a supported router. My vision for this is to have some kind of web installer, akin to what GrapheneOS does with their web-installer. It seems to be possible to do SSH from the browser, but I'll kill that bird when I see it (is that a saying? I think it should be...)\n\nBy the way, in earlier docs/demo's we talked about a 'herald' module, which would do the advertising of the tollgate. But as we found that the crowsnest already interacts with the hardware antennas, which is needed for 'advertising' the tollgate, we thought it better to merge both of them into the Crowsnest.\n\n## Developers\nTollGate is fully open source, so anyone looking to either look at or fork the source code is welcome to do so. Developers interested at looking at the code are probably already interested to some degree. For this group we added easy links to navigate to the project's repositories\n\nCurrently our focus is publishing the Android version, but we're building the app in a cross-platform way. The only thing we have to customize are the system integrations, like scanning for wifi-networks and connecting to them.\n\n## Gearing up for Sovereign Engineering\nAs i'm writing this piece for you i'm at 10km (that's 30.000ft for y'all Americans) in the air on my way to Sovereign Engineering edition #4, SEC-04.

The Facts must've been hitting too hard...**\n\n## Reflecting on networks\nA lot of my time this week was reflecting on the event and all the contacts I'd made there. There has been a surprising lot of enthusiasm of the community about Tollgate specifically. There's something that draws me to the project and i think it's not even the flashy-ness of routers paying routers, I'm starting to see the bigger possible implications of the sovereign networks that can grow from this. Not for the western world per se but for places that want to build out new infrastrucutre with their own communities. One of the worries from people to operate TollGates is if they'll get trouble with their ISP's. Which is a legitimate worry, but how long will that worry be relevant? \n\nOne thing I realize, as Nostr grows -and Blossom too- is that the data we pull in will be more localized. Imagine a city equipped with a Sovereign Tollgate network. If a few people in your city have watched a video, there will likely be a copy of that video inside the city-wide network. Then if the city get's cut off for any reason, that video will still be very much accessible and people might not even notice the 'internet is down'. I woke up in the middle of the night and had to draw out this visualization of the combination of Clearnet + Tor + TollGate networks and how they can interact with Epoxy proxies in between (visualized by the ♾️ symbol). Anyone that sees an opportunity to bridge the networks can jump in and be that link.\n\nEven attacking (DDOS) services within other networks might become harder, because either:\n1) you have to have your botnet reside inside the network of the victim. Which, if it's a small network won't comprise of a significant amount of nodes.\n2) you have to have to route your attack through (Epoxy) bridges known to you, the attacker. Which likely have limited bandwidth.\n\n![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/10f4c8c02ffed3ebfc167c6d7580bbcd025b4ef2a206581f2d59626439ab063a.jpeg)\nAnyway, this is just my 3 AM brain-dump. I'll keep chewing on this...\n\n## Marketing TollGate\nLike I mentioned earlier there was a lot of interest in Tollgate and to be honest it's been a bit overwhelming, there are so many opportunities like podcasts, meetups and articles opening up to share it and talk about it that I have to think about the form in which I want to relate myself to the project. In any case, these are Good problems to have...\n\nIn the meanwhile we've worked on getting a good website landingpage where we can point people to that are interested in the project, it should be up soon!\n- Consumers can download the Android (for now) app\n- Operators can download TollGateOS to put on their router\n- FAQ's\n\nAlso, i've been helping out to get some stuff automated. so we can build and push new versions quickly to start getting user feedback and enable iterating on a fast pace!","sig":"bf0eacac31c67154169bf2e4f47c6cac5f3cf0516fc10ab9e3f3a37ccfc5bddfba4a34c08bc506b43f27c4ff1300e20ceae6bedb489fd94b4f2e78b4cb41ac3d"},"naddr1qq2nz63h0969vn2xwse9j3n5ge4xsdr2ddc4jqgswaehxw309ahx7um5wgh8w6twv5pzpwa4mkswz4t8j70s2s6q00wzqv7k7zamxrmj2y4fs88aktcfuf68qvzqqqr4gusta7s8":{"kind":30023,"id":"9f5d8430567a4b54c0b18dc8c30b20db0cc6bb271ed9b367956799cc3473cd6d","pubkey":"bbb5dda0e15567979f0543407bdc2033d6f0bbb30f72512a981cfdb2f09e2747","created_at":1739251198,"tags":[["client","Yakihonne","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["published_at","1739251198"],["d","1j7ytVMFt2YFtFjh4jkqY"],["image","https://cdn.satellite.earth/fdbdf6be3d7f73612501ad39f23647a3dfda56563fe68f10b886da5fd6d94cb1.png"],["title","My week (6) in review - Sats 'n Facts"],["summary","There's nothing like the ability of a Nostr/Bitcoin meetup to bring your bullish-ness back to a 120%.

This is the reason I made such a push on the TollGate Android app, because I wanted to show the world the potential implications of this technology when applied in practice. We get the ability to build our own (physical!) sovereign network infrastructure. Maybe it doesn't sound too sexy for rich western countries, but very valuable for regions with lacking digital infrastructure, or regular powercuts (something I learned at the conference, that TollGate could be applied to bridge those).\n\n![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/fdbdf6be3d7f73612501ad39f23647a3dfda56563fe68f10b886da5fd6d94cb1.png)\nAbove: Illustration how a TollGate network connects to the legacy internet.\n\nI did a presentation about the project and did a demo, which as the universe commands, suffered from the [demo-effect](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=demo%20effect). Despite that, it was very well-received and the feedback and ideas on how and where to apply this were amazing. From splitting your bill with your neighbour, to strapping 5g-enabled routers to a light-fixture in the city, everyone had their own ideas on how to use it, and the cool thing is that all of it can be done.\n\n## Presenting GitHub Actions \u0026 Epoxy\nI held a seperate session on the GitHub actions project and Epoxy. The response was great and I have some more feedback coming in a 1-on-1 session, so I'm sure i'll be posting about that in the near future.\n\n## A realization about Epoxy + TollGate\nThe more I talk about Epoxy and TollGate, the more I realize how much they are related. Epoxy is a way of bridging connectivity between Nostr users that are on clearnet and want to connect to Relays that are on Tor. But rather than just bridging the captured clearnet and tor, it can be the bridge between clearnet and a community TollGate network, or between different TollGate networks.\n\nAs I've thought more about the implications of sovereign TollGate based networks, I think the introduction of many TollGate networks might create a fracturing of the broader internet, which I'd argue is not even a bad thing as this fracturing can reduce centralized surveillance and control. If we'd do this within the conventional way of operating services - think API's \u0026 talking directly to servers- that would be a problem as we need to reach those servers at any moment in time. But given the decentralized Nature of Nostr messages + Blossom files, you might not even notice it if your geographical region gets cut off from the rest of the world, because the content likely already exists within your -now cut off- network.\n\nIf we can get our content local, why wouldn't we embrace this fractured internet and use it in our advantage.\n\nnostr:naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzpwa4mkswz4t8j70s2s6q00wzqv7k7zamxrmj2y4fs88aktcfuf68qq3k2ur00puj6mt0dejhg6t6v93xcefdwajkyum0vd4k2apdwpex77rfv4esk0qk8g\n\n## A final word\nI'm incredible grateful to be meeting all these talented developers, artists and community builders! I love to see art being integrated into the broader ecosystem and I think us dev's need to lean on the community builders to get our projects out into the world, they often have the insight on how our software shapes the lives of the communities they help to grow.

If a user signs into a new nostr client and it starts asking them to sign kind 1 events with blobs of JSON, they will sign it without thinking too much about it.\n\nThen when they return to their comfy social apps they will see that they made 10+ posts with massive amounts of gibberish that they don't remember posting. then they probably will go looking for the delete button and realize there isn't one...\n\nEven if those kind 1 posts don't contain JSON and have a nice fancy human readable syntax. they will still confuse users because they won't remember writing those social posts\n\n## What about \"discoverability\"\n\nIf your goal is to make your \"other stuff\" app visible to more users, then I would suggest using [NIP-19](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/19.md) and [NIP-89](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/89.md)\nThe first allows users to embed any other event kind into social posts as `nostr:nevent1` or `nostr:naddr1` links, and the second allows social clients to redirect users to an app that knows how to handle that specific kind of event\n\nSo instead of saving your apps data into kind 1 events. you can pick any kind you want, then give users a \"share on nostr\" button that allows them to compose a social post (kind 1) with a `nostr:` link to your special kind of event and by extension you app\n\n## Why its a trap\n\nOnce users start using your app it becomes a lot more difficult to migrate to a new event kind or data format.\nThis sounds obvious, but If your app is built on kind 1 events that means you will be stuck with their limitations forever. \n\nFor example, here are some of the limitations of using kind 1\n - Querying for your apps data becomes much more difficult. You have to filter through all of a users kind 1 events to find which ones are created by your app\n - Discovering your apps data is more difficult for the same reason, you have to sift through all the social posts just to find the ones with you special tag or that contain JSON\n - Users get confused. as mentioned above users don't expect \"other stuff\" apps to be creating special social posts\n - Other nostr clients won't understand your data and will show it as a social post with no option for users to learn about your app","sig":"e4c3a834a2625cb955e69dda7f43433f7ade6f9bd7de036f6f0e7444e20547bc89f98ad999be82af891a0c4d9f0e7f63680cc4df4aafd9375b7419045d9ad305"},"naddr1qq2xwctjd35kxttrv9ekseth94ex2cmfwpjszyrhwden5te0dehhxarj9emkjmn9qgsd73u9dpremcntf2pur0wymw4krdwvsts6xyhzk29us9dp9223uecrqsqqqa28sms6aa":{"kind":30023,"id":"ab4b5deb7615e03f5473ba18a8be21d0f314799c1f198e8b518c7270ef43c22f","pubkey":"df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67","created_at":1738422446,"tags":[["d","garlic-cashew-recipe"],["title","Garlic Cashew Recipe"],["summary","The article discusses selling roasted cashews as an experiment in capitalism and provides a ciphered recipe for garlic-roasted cashews.

In the context of nostr, currently everyone connects to a relay directly, which you may not always want. The relay can keep track of your IP address and build a profile, or your device might be behind a very restrictive firewall which prevents you from reaching a relay.\n\nFrom this problem, the idea for proxy relays was born. We wanted to reach a TOR relay, without having to install any TOR stuff on our devices. Which on iPhones is especially challenging. So the idea is that we want to extend a relay's functionality so that it can instead of processing requests for itself, it can pass on the requests to another relay that they themselves can reach.\n\nThe easiest solution to get this working is in the form of a Reverse Proxy, which you can put in front of any relay, which by default tunnels the traffic to the operator's own relay, for example a Strfry instance. That way the relay implementation doesn't have to change and the user doesn't have to be aware that this relay endpoint can also proxy to other relays. The example implementation is called [NERP - Nostr Epoxy Reverse Proxy](nostr:naddr1qvzqqqrhnypzpwa4mkswz4t8j70s2s6q00wzqv7k7zamxrmj2y4fs88aktcfuf68qy88wumn8ghj7mn0wvhxcmmv9uqpjmn0wd68ytt9wphhs7fdwfjhvetjwdjj6urjdau8j6sn6y7).\n\n| ![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/d124f0ba7bfe0467ce90f2bbf465eef1d67ac0e1dec6732e24432552da7e9c18.png) | ![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/7f9b64ce58f372415e7dfe57b3457069a7ca9a8ce1b69677b1884ebc0e2ebca4.png) |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Reverse proxy default behaviour                                                                       | Reverse proxy after proxy request                                                                     |\n\nAs shown above the default is to connect to the operator's own relay. So how do we create the proxied connection? Well we send the following request over our websocket:\n\n```json\n[\"PROXY\", \"wss://relay.com\"]\n```\n\nWhich asks the proxy to change the target from it's own back-end to whatever we specify. In this case `wss://relay.com`. However, it turns out this relay doesn't live in a fiat world, it responds with:\n\n`[\"PROXY\", \"PAYMENT_REQURIED\", \u003cpayment_request\u003e]` where `\u003cpayment_request\u003e` is an object:\n```json\n{\n  \"price\": \"1\",\n  \"unit\": \"sat\",\n  \"mint\": \"https://some.mint.cash/\",\n}\n```\n\nWhich brings us to...\n## 💰 Monetizing proxies\nInevitably we're going to hit the \"Who's gonna run the proxies!?\" question. Well you are, because you want to stack some sats. Therefore we added monetization to these proxies, which is what sets this project apart from current-day proxies on the internet. When the client is hit with the `PAYMENT_REQUIRED` message above, it can retry the first message, but with an additional field, a cashu payment.\n\n```json\n[\"PROXY\", \"wss://relay.com\", \"cashuAeyJ0...\"]\n```\n\nWe're now paying a couple sats, (the price above is in sats per minute). If the proxy is happy with our payment, it will start a timer and set up the connection to the target relay. Indicated by a `[\"PROXY\", \"CONNECTED\"]` message, after which we can go about our relay business until the bought time runs out. After which the proxy will close our connection with code `1000`, reason: `PROXY: Connection Bankrupted`.\n\nThe nice thing here is that introducing payments can reduce spam significantly.\n\n### Why Cashu?\nBecause [Cashu eCash](https://cashu.me) allows us to finally make micro-payments viable and scalable, it can help us to bring an honest monetary reward to the people that do the hard work of maintaining the free and open internet. If you provide a proxy, you get paid and therefore you're incentivised to keep the infrastructure up and running.\n\nCashu tokens are a very efficient way of sending payments directly. Unlike Lightning, it does not require a back and forth between the two transacting parties. Because cashu tokens can be sent as a string of text, you can attach it to any request/data you're sending around. Even at rest, the money will still be 'physically' there. That means there's no back and forth required to send a payment, like we do on lightning, and people don't need perfect connectivity.\n\n## 💭 Some philosophy\nUntil now, all web applications have been strongly coupled to the transportation methods they use, mainly http(s). Nostr changes this, because the data that feeds an application can now arrive over any transportation mechanism. WebSockets, Thumb-drives, QR, LoRa (radio) and Heck! even FM and pigeons will work!\n\nAlthough the above point is not necessarily tied to the use of websocket proxies, it does underline the point I want to make: Because Nostr completely decouples applications from the transportation layer, We can get VERY creative in the ways in which we transport application data... Therefore, the boundaries of the current clearnet network become irrelevant.\n\nUsing the websocket proxies, we can now hop from clearnet to tor, to [i2p](https://geti2p.net/en/), to [hyper](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol) and back to clearnet. This significantly reduces the burden on the client by not having to 'know' how any of these other networks work, they won't have to install anything, yet they can interact with relays on these lesser known networks.\n## ⚙ Under the hood\nHere's a UMl example of a proxy (that does not have a default relay behind it) and the lifecycle of a proxied connection.\n![uml](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/dLBBJiCm4BpxA_O3Gjfp3gXHwWD8926KHq_8n2irIXmNFw3vUn85OaJtGeyxE-ETiMPZdJ3Eguw9sca3cRTEApHicfiFuN210b8QVHfIzhE0g-jl218eZjZ3CxvPNRVes8nFZ8MTW6vfRLaLB_i8FgrDLYk3dHXYAPItSQFfXyfqVyVptMl5xnzlAhwDe1I3mjv1XUyUhVltdGXgOGy-nU5s7STno5nDjE1Ydi_ppl3lOxeDge0-e0FNA3H4iE0mA_ASPpk-POnECWQ7jkabh0bhOKdOua_Znn77bzL56Y9fwKrz41O1JyV6eAJrMQSjKhsPqn0CYN_xAF6yinlivTZkBm00)\n\n## NIP-XX draft\nI wrote a draft NIP on how to support proxying [here](https://github.com/ArjenStens/nostr-epoxy-reverse-proxy/blob/main/NIP-XX.md).\n## 🛝 Play with it!\nI created a [Dashboard](https://swissdash.site) to discover proxies and play with connecting to relays (multiple hops are possible). \n\n![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/9fb3810bd6a7ac147e9a07185e7b4c42c9109f1791296d9ebbf3e7b1530ee7d0.png)\n\nCheck out the route-builder tab, add a couple sats to the wallet and route some request through the proxies.\n![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/93ce43af5d92ff4f253acb064f0995a21e20dafd29a1dfb7f1ecaef4babcbe5b.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.satellite.earth/1a6163c1486098a45d577639b324c13e9e22bde32ddfae44ffb702702797c59d.png)\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Dashboard](https://swissdash.site)\n- **Nostr Epoxy Reverse Proxy** [Source Code](nostr:naddr1qvzqqqrhnypzpwa4mkswz4t8j70s2s6q00wzqv7k7zamxrmj2y4fs88aktcfuf68qy88wumn8ghj7mn0wvhxcmmv9uqpjmn0wd68ytt9wphhs7fdwfjhvetjwdjj6urjdau8j6sn6y7)\n- **NIP** [draft](https://github.com/ArjenStens/nostr-epoxy-reverse-proxy/blob/main/NIP-XX.md)","sig":"a8913c81edfb4c8b7f23129643bd51127ef7830fc6f61d16b11b147c6030678e9cb9ffa61e86ec6d41d2106e6a4c074ba466b12375bac169984e147f7c7a926e"},"naddr1qq3yy6t5vdhkjm3df9h8vetnw3kk2mn594tk2ett9489jsedwvuhyem5vuq3vamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwwpexjmtpdshxuet5qgst32wlsgvqsnjfpkygxs4f6jyt0nc0kg935xdevwlv668dd26uh0grqsqqqa28ftlysn":{"kind":30023,"id":"673ce6ff48b4c04b8c66094c9a2e6044df9ac8eea2c529bf52e91ea6affcef9b","pubkey":"b8a9df8218084e490d888342a9d488b7cf0fb20b1a19b963becd68ed6ab5cbbd","created_at":1741300755,"tags":[["image","https://blossom.primal.net/1d6f4625321924c831eedc226c7d6c96828a5ce694cae7e02d36cfd09c3397e1.jpg"],["title","Bitcoin Investment Week NYC"],["summary","Where were the plebs?"],["t","nostr"],["t","travel"],["t","writestr"],["t","plebs"],["published_at","1741300755"],["d","Bitcoin-Investment-Week-NYC-s9rgtg"]],"content":"Last week at Bitcoin Investment Week in New York City, hosted by Anthony Pompliano, Jack Mallers walked in wearing sneakers and a T-shirt, casually dropping, “Man… I hate politics.”\n\nThat was it. That was the moment I felt aligned again. That’s the energy I came for. No suits. No corporate jargon. Just a guy who gets it—who cares about people, bringing Bitcoin-powered payments to the masses and making sure people can actually use it.\n\nHis presence was a reminder of why we’re here in the first place. And his words—“I hate politics”—were a breath of fresh air.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong. Anthony was a fantastic host. His ability to mix wittiness, playfulness, and seriousness made him an entertaining moderator. But this week was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nOne of the biggest letdowns was the lack of interaction. No real Q\u0026A sessions, no direct engagement, no real discussions. Just one fireside chat after another.\n\nAnd sure, I get it—people love to hear themselves talk. But where were the questions? The critical debates? The chance for the audience to actually participate?\n\nI’m used to Bitcoin meetups and conferences where you walk away with new ideas, new friends, and maybe even a new project to contribute to. Here, it was more like sitting in an expensive lecture hall, watching a lineup of speakers tell us things we already know.\n\nA different vibe—and not in a good way\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve attended nearly ten Bitcoin conferences, each leaving me feeling uplifted, inspired, and ready to take action. But this? This felt different. And not in a good way.\n\nIf this had been my first Bitcoin event, I might have walked away questioning whether I even belonged here. It wasn’t Prague. It wasn’t Riga. It wasn’t the buzzing, grassroots, pleb-filled gatherings I had grown to love. Instead, it felt more like a Wall Street networking event disguised as a Bitcoin conference.\n\nMaybe it was the suits.\n\nOr the fact that I was sitting in a room full of investors who have no problem dropping $1,000+ on a ticket.\n\nOr that it reminded me way too much of my former life—working as a manager in London’s real estate industry, navigating boardrooms full of finance guys in polished shoes, talking about “assets under management.”\n\nBitcoin isn’t just an investment thesis. It’s a revolution. A movement. And yet, at times during this week, I felt like I was back in my fiat past, stuck in a room where people measured success in dollars, not in freedom.\n\nMaybe that’s the point. Bitcoin Investment Week was never meant to be a pleb gathering.\n\nThat said, the week did have some bright spots. PubKey was a fantastic kickoff. That was real Bitcoin culture—plebs, Nostr, grassroots energy. People who actually use Bitcoin, not just talk about it.\n\nBut the absolute highlight? Jack Mallers, sneakers and all, cutting through the noise with his authenticity.\n\nSo, why did we even go?\n\nGood question. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe it was stepping out of our usual circles to see Bitcoin through a different lens. Maybe it was to remind ourselves why we chose this path in the first place.\n\nWould I go again? Probably not.\n\nWould I trade Prague, Riga, bitcoin++ or any of the grassroots Bitcoin conferences for this? Not a chance.\n\nAt the end of the day, Bitcoin doesn’t belong to Wall Street from my opinion. It belongs to the people who actually use it. And those are the people I want to be around.","sig":"088f53d313eb3597a288c2859c95812e3a34bb8d56128a346cffaecc3e2d63d380e8bb8e476f92a6b0b08904ce7d7b18ce6ee81f626927823624e7c95b7742ec"},"naddr1qq4kzar0d45kxttnd9nkuct5w4ex2ttnwashqueddamx2u3ddehhxarj956z7vfs9uerqv34qyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyqan5sknfnc2zspdrr2ndjwj4shtr3spn2g480jhppxgzew3jt3j2qcyqqq823cpgd3tc":{"kind":30023,"id":"7b63b1130fe449f8e870ea2184fde1125fe5c4b15a65cdc699204a4ebf62113c","pubkey":"3b3a42d34cf0a1402d18d536c9d2ac2eb1c6019a9153be57084c8165d192e325","created_at":1744275471,"tags":[["d","atomic-signature-swaps-over-nostr-4/10/2025"],["title","Atomic Signature Swaps over Nostr"],["summary","A protocol for atomically exchanging Schnorr signatures using Nostr events developed during Sovereign Engineering SEC-04.

This new primitive enables multiple interesting applications like:\n\n* Getting paid to publish specific Nostr events\n* Issuing automatic payment receipts\n* Contract signing in exchange for payment\n* P2P asset exchanges\n* Trading and enforcement of asset option contracts\n* Payment in exchange for Nostr-based credentials or access tokens\n* [Exchanging GMs 🌞](https://gm-nostr.vercel.app/)\n\nIt only requires that (i) the involved signatures be Schnorr signatures using the *secp256k1* curve and that (ii) at least one of those signatures be accessible to both parties. These requirements are naturally met by Nostr events (published to relays), Taproot transactions (published to the mempool and later to the blockchain), and Cashu payments (using mints that support [NUT-07](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/07.md), allowing any pair of these signatures to be swapped atomically.\n\n## How the Cryptographic Magic Works 🪄\n\nThis is a Schnorr signature `(Zₓ, s)`:\n\n`s = z + H(Zₓ || P || m)⋅k`\n\nIf you haven't seen it before, don't worry, neither did I until three weeks ago.\n\nThe *signature scalar* **s** is the the value a signer with private key `k` (and public key `P = k⋅G`) must calculate to prove his commitment over the message `m` given a randomly generated *nonce* `z` (`Zₓ` is just the x-coordinate of the public point `Z = z⋅G`). `H` is a hash function (*sha256* with the tag *\"BIP0340/challenge\"* when dealing with [BIP340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki)), `||` just means to *concatenate* and `G` is the generator point of the elliptic curve, used to derive public values from private ones.\n\nNow that you understand what this equation means, let's just rename `z = r + t`. We can do that, `z` is just a randomly generated number that can be represented as the sum of two other numbers. It also follows that `z⋅G = r⋅G + t⋅G ⇔ Z = R + T`. Putting it all back into the definition of a Schnorr signature we get:\n\n`s = (r + t) + H((R + T)ₓ || P || m)⋅k`\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n`s = sₐ + t`    where    `sₐ =  r + H((R + T)ₓ || P || m)⋅k`\n\n`sₐ` is what we call the [adaptor signature scalar]([https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/scriptless-scripts](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/scriptless-scripts \"https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/scriptless-scripts\")) and **t** is the *secret*. `((R + T)ₓ, sₐ)` is an incomplete signature that just becomes valid by add the *secret* **t** to the `sₐ`:\n\n`s = sₐ + t`\n\nWhat is also important for our purposes is that by getting access to the valid signature **s**, one can also extract **t** from it by just subtracting `sₐ`:\n\n`t = s - sₐ`\n\nThe specific value of `t` depends on our choice of the public point `T`, since `R` is just a public point derived from a randomly generated nonce `r`.\n\nSo how do we choose `T` so that it requires the *secret* **t** to be the signature over a specific message `m'` by an specific public key `P'`? (without knowing the value of `t`)\n\nLet's start with the definition of **t** as a valid Schnorr signature by **P'** over **m'**:\n\n`t = r' + H(R'ₓ || P' || m')⋅k'  ⇔  t⋅G = r'⋅G + H(R'ₓ || P' || m')⋅k'⋅G`\n\nThat is the same as:\n\n`T = R' + H(R'ₓ || P' || m')⋅P'`\n\nNotice that in order to calculate the appropriate `T` that requires `t` to be an specific *signature scalar*, we **only** need to know the *public nonce* `R'` used to generate that signature.\n\n**In summary**: in order to atomically swap Schnorr signatures, one party `P'` must provide a *public nonce* `R'`, while the other party `P` must provide an adaptor signature using that nonce:\n\n`sₐ =  r + H((R + T)ₓ || P || m)⋅k`    where    `T = R' + H(R'ₓ || P' || m')⋅P'`\n\n`P'` (the *nonce provider*) can then add his own signature **t** to the adaptor signature `sₐ` in order to get a valid signature by `P`, i.e. `s = sₐ + t`. When he publishes this signature (as a Nostr event, Cashu transaction or Taproot transaction), it becomes accessible to `P`  that can now extract the signature `t` by `P'` and also make use of it.\n\n### Important considerations\n\nA signature may not be useful at the end of the swap if it unlocks funds that have **already been spent**, or that are vulnerable to **fee bidding wars**.\n\nWhen a swap involves a Taproot UTXO, it **must always** use a *2-of-2 multisig timelock* to avoid those issues.\n\nCashu tokens do not require this measure when its signature is revealed first, because the mint won't reveal the other signature if they can't be successfully claimed, but they also require a *2-of-2 multisig timelock* when its signature is only revealed last (what is unavoidable in *cashu for cashu* swaps).\n\nFor Nostr events, whoever receives the signature first needs to publish it to at least one relay that is accessible by the other party. This is a reasonable expectation in most cases, but may be an issue if the event kind involved is meant to be used privately.\n\n## How to Orchestrate the Swap over Nostr?\n\nBefore going into the specific event kinds, it is important to recognize what are the requirements they must meet and what are the concerns they must address. There are mainly three requirements:\n\n* Both parties must agree on the messages they are going to sign\n* One party must provide a *public nonce*\n* The other party must provide an *adaptor signature* using that nonce\n\nThere is also a fundamental asymmetry in the roles of both parties, resulting in the following significant **downsides for the party that generates the adaptor signature**:\n\n* NIP-07 and remote signers do not currently support the generation of adaptor signatures, so he must either insert his nsec in the client or use a fork of another signer\n* There is an overhead of retrieving the completed signature containing the *secret*, either from the blockchain, mint endpoint or finding the appropriate relay\n* There is risk he may not get his side of the deal if the other party only uses his signature privately, as I have already mentioned\n* There is risk of losing funds by not extracting or using the signature before its timelock expires. The other party has no risk since his own signature won't be exposed by just not using the signature he received.\n\nThe protocol must meet all those requirements, allowing for some kind of role negotiation and while trying to reduce the necessary hops needed to complete the swap.\n\n### Swap Proposal Event (kind:455)\n\nThis event enables a *proposer* and his *counterparty* to agree on the specific messages whose signatures they intend to exchange. The `content` field is the following stringified JSON:\n\n```\n{\n    \"give\": \u003csignature spec (required)\u003e,\n    \"take\": \u003csignature spec (required)\u003e,\n    \"exp\": \u003cexpiration timestamp (optional)\u003e,\n    \"role\": \"\u003cadaptor | nonce (optional)\u003e\",\n    \"description\": \"\u003cInfo about the proposal (optional)\u003e\",\n    \"nonce\": \"\u003cSignature public nonce (optional)\u003e\",\n    \"enc_s\": \"\u003cEncrypted signature scalar (optional)\u003e\"\n}\n```\n\nThe field `role` indicates what the *proposer* will provide during the swap, either the *nonce* or the *adaptor*. When this optional field is not provided, the counterparty may decide whether he will send a nonce back in a *Swap Nonce event* or a *Swap Adaptor event* using the `nonce` (optionally) provided by in the *Swap Proposal* in order to avoid one hop of interaction.\n\nThe `enc_s` field may be used to store the encrypted scalar of the signature associated with the `nonce`, since this information is necessary later when completing the *adaptor signature* received from the other party.\n \nA `signature spec` specifies the `type` and all necessary information for producing and verifying a given signature. In the case of signatures for *Nostr events*, it contain a template with all the fields, except `pubkey`, `id` and `sig`:\n\n```\n{\n\t\"type\": \"nostr\",\n\t\"template\": {\n\t\t\"kind\": \"\u003ckind\u003e\"\n        \"content\": \"\u003ccontent\u003e\"\n        \"tags\": [ … ],\n        \"created_at\": \"\u003ccreated_at\u003e\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn the case of Cashu payments, a simplified `signature spec` just needs to specify the payment amount and an array of mints trusted by the *proposer*:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"cashu\",\n  \"amount\": \"\u003camount\u003e\",\n  \"mint\": [\"\u003cacceptable mint_url\u003e\", …]\n}\n```\n\nThis works when the payer provides the *adaptor signature*, but it still needs to be extended to also work when the payer is the one receiving the *adaptor signature*. In the later case, the `signature spec` must also include a `timelock` and the *derived public keys* `Y` of each *Cashu Proof*, but for now let's just ignore this situation. It should be mentioned that the mint must be **trusted by both parties** and also support *Token state check* ([NUT-07](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/07.md)) for revealing the completed adaptor signature and *P2PK spending conditions* ([NUT-11](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/11.md)) for the cryptographic scheme to work.\n\nThe `tags` are:\n\n* `\"p\"`, the proposal counterparty's public key (required)\n* `\"a\"`, a `kind:30455` *Swap Listing event*  or an application specific version of it (optional)\n\nForget about this *Swap Listing event* for now, I will get to it later...\n\n### Swap Nonce Event (kind:456) - Optional\n\nThis is an optional event for the *Swap Proposal* receiver to provide the *public nonce* of his signature when the proposal does not include a *nonce* or when he does not want to provide the *adaptor signature* due to the downsides previously mentioned. The `content` field is the following stringified JSON:\n\n```\n{\n    \"nonce\": \"\u003cSignature public nonce\u003e\",\n    \"enc_s\": \"\u003cEncrypted signature scalar (optional)\u003e\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the `tags` must contain:\n\n* `\"e\"`, a `kind:455` Swap Proposal Event (required)\n* `\"p\"`, the counterparty's public key (required)\n\n### Swap Adaptor Event (kind:457)\n\nThe `content` field is the following stringified JSON:\n\n```\n{\n    \"adaptors\": [\n\t    {\n\t        \"sa\": \"\u003cAdaptor signature scalar\u003e\",\n\t        \"R\": \"\u003cSigner's public nonce (including parity byte)\u003e\",\n\t        \"T\": \"\u003cAdaptor point (including parity byte)\u003e\",\n\t        \"Y\": \"\u003cCashu proof derived public key (if applicable)\u003e\",\n\t    }, …],\n    \"cashu\": \"\u003cCashu V4 token (if applicable)\u003e\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the `tags` must contain:\n\n* `\"e\"`, a `kind:455` Swap Proposal Event (required)\n* `\"p\"`, the counterparty's public key (required)\n\n## Discoverability\n\nThe Swap Listing event previously mentioned as an optional tag in the Swap Proposal may be used to find an appropriate counterparty for a swap. It allows a user to announce what he wants to accomplish, what his requirements are and what is still open for negotiation.\n\n### Swap Listing Event (kind:30455)\n\nThe `content` field is the following stringified JSON:\n\n```\n{\n\t\"description\": \"\u003cInformation about the listing (required)\u003e\",\n\t\"give\": \u003cpartial signature spec (optional)\u003e,\n\t\"take\": \u003cpartial signature spec (optional)\u003e,\n\t\"examples: [\u003ctake signature spec\u003e], // optional\n\t\"exp\": \u003cexpiration timestamp (optional)\u003e,\n\t\"role\": \"\u003cadaptor | nonce (optional)\u003e\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `description` field describes the restrictions on counterparties and signatures the user is willing to accept.\n\nA `partial signature spec` is an incomplete `signature spec` used in *Swap Proposal event*s  `kind:455` where omitting fields signals that they are still open for negotiation.\n\nThe `examples` field is an array of `signature specs` the user would be willing to `take`.\n\nThe `tags` are:\n\n* `\"d\"`, a unique listing id (required)\n* `\"s\"`, the status of the listing `draft | open | closed` (required)\n* `\"t\"`, topics related to this listing (optional)\n* `\"p\"`, public keys to notify about the proposal (optional)\n\n### Application Specific Swap Listings\n\nSince *Swap Listings* are still fairly generic, it is expected that specific use cases define new *event kinds* based on the generic listing. Those application specific swap listing would be easier to filter by clients and may impose restrictions and add new fields and/or tags. The following are some examples under development:\n\n#### Sponsored Events\n\nThis listing is designed for users looking to promote content on the Nostr network, as well as for those who want to monetize their accounts by sharing curated sponsored content with their existing audiences.\n\nIt follows the same format as the generic *Swap Listing event*, but uses the `kind:30456` instead. \n\nThe following new tags are included:\n\n- `\"k\"`, event kind being sponsored (required)\n- `\"title\"`, campaign title (optional)\n\nIt is required that at least one `signature spec` (`give` and/or `take`) must have `\"type\": \"nostr\"` and also contain the following tag `[\"sponsor\", \"\u003cpubkey\u003e\", \"\u003cattestation\u003e\"]` with the sponsor's public key and his signature over the signature spec without the sponsor tag as his attestation. This last requirement enables clients to disclose and/or filter sponsored events.\n\n#### Asset Swaps\n\nThis listing is designed for users looking for counterparties to swap different assets that can be transferred using Schnorr signatures, like any unit of Cashu tokens, Bitcoin or other asset IOUs issued using Taproot.\n\nIt follows the same format as the generic *Swap Listing event*, but uses the `kind:30457` instead. \n\nIt requires the following additional tags:\n\n- `\"t\"`, asset pair to be swapped (e.g. `\"btcusd\"`)\n- `\"t\"`, asset being offered (e.g. `\"btc\"`)\n- `\"t\"`, accepted payment method (e.g. `\"cashu\"`, `\"taproot\"`)\n\n### Swap Negotiation\n\nFrom finding an appropriate Swap Listing to publishing a Swap Proposal, there may be some kind of negotiation between the involved parties, e.g. agreeing on the amount to be paid by one of the parties or the exact content of a Nostr event signed by the other party. There are many ways to accomplish that and clients may implement it as they see fit for their specific goals. Some suggestions are:\n\n* Adding `kind:1111` [Comments](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/22.md) to the Swap Listing or an existing Swap Proposal\n* Exchanging tentative Swap Proposals back and forth until an agreement is reached\n* Simple exchanges of DMs\n* Out of band communication (e.g. Signal)\n\n## Work to be done\n\nI've been refining this specification as I develop some proof-of-concept clients to experience its flaws and trade-offs in practice. I left the *signature spec* for Taproot signatures out of the current document as I still have to experiment with it. I will probably find some important orchestration issues related to dealing with `2-of-2 multisig timelocks`, which also affects Cashu transactions when spent last, that may require further adjustments to what was presented here.\n\nThe main goal of this article is to find other people interested in this concept and willing to provide valuable feedback before a PR is opened in the NIPs repository for broader discussions.\n\n## References\n\n* [GM Swap](https://github.com/vstabile/gm-swap)- Nostr client for atomically exchanging GM notes.

It seemed that for some reason, Alby Wallet was having trouble connecting to my node. (perhaps due to it starting up and shutting down so many times). Well the node was fine, I confirmed, but I was prevented from reading the Nostr settings and data by an infinite loading circle.\n\nNostr keys are basically like xpub/xprv keys in Bitcoin except that they start with npub and nsec respectively. They are still encoded in Bech32 I think. You use them to chat at the Nostr social network. A decentralized X/Twitter basically.\n\nEventually, I thought I had found a backup of my Nostr keys in my password manager, and proceeded to clear all the placeholder entries in my wallet, including the Nostr wallet.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nIt turned out that the mnemonic I had saved in my password manager makes a completely different key and that I had actually imported the Nostr secret key form another program rather than generated a menmonic phrase.\n\nNaturally, I started to panic as I did not have any copies of it. I thought about inspecting the Chrome browser for the data directly, but by that point I had already deleted the Nostr keys.\n\nBut then I remembered that I make backups of my whole system in the early morning and save them on some server, including my Chrome profile, so I thought why not look inside the backup and see if I can find it. But I had to hurry because the files would be overwritten in about 24 hours from then.\n\nI didn't actually know how I was going to go about and get my keys from the backups except for the fact that I knew that extensions have a long identifier like *iokeahhehimjnekafflcihljlcjccdbe* and that each extension has a folder with that sort of name in the Extensions directory of the Chrome user data dir.\n\nWhat followed next would be an adventure in coding, lobbing open database files, and encryption.\n\n# Locating the extension settings\n\nAs I definitely remembered my wallet password and name, I would be able to decrypt the wallet if I ever found it. Which was the first problem - I wasn't really sure where it was.\n\nThe fine details of my backup structure meant that all the config files were in a tarball, so I just did a scan for the extension ID, which yielded, among other results, this:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/eb5d1f0ec614eb073c5f73fe74d339b54c2230aef21de13e4a58234b072cf334.png\"\u003e\n\nSo I at least knew where the extension settings live, but I wasn't sure what any of the files did. AGI was mostly useless for this, except for telling me that those IndexedDB folders must have contained my settings. Spoiler alert: they didn't - and I wasted an hour trying to open the LevelDB file inside, which by the way were specially modified for Chrome so could not even be opened in regular libraries.\n\nIt turned out that parsing the database file with a library was a huge waste of time, so eventually I just used tools like cat and less to read the lines. I had better luck with the Sync Extension Settings folder though, and when you open it it looks something like this:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/0e38a1efa4ea4fdaff0eb8c8519fdf2c46ca8aeba161b91a1de81d150fcca74a.png\"\u003e\n\nDon't worry, everything is encrypted. And it appears to be encoded in base64.\n\n# Decrypting the payload\n\nFor what came next, I had to look at Alby Wallet's source code on Github. And I happened to learn a lot about how Alby Wallet worked under the hood. Like did you know that there is actually an API just for extracting settings from the disk? Which was what I needed to see.\n\nA couple of minutes of browsing brought me to this file: [getPrivateKey.ts](https://github.com/getAlby/lightning-browser-extension/blob/3a4a06311f79d64ace5a5c5e7de9fcb36303b123/src/extension/background-script/actions/nostr/getPrivateKey.ts)\n\nAnd so it became clear to me that 1) All this is Typescript, which I am glad I still remember, and 2) those \"getPrivateKey\" fields were indeed my Nostr private key. (Later on decryption I also found my LN node URL and admin macaroon.) But although I knew my password, I did not know what decryption algorithm it is using. The good news is that I found it in another file called [common/lib/crypto.ts](https://github.com/getAlby/lightning-browser-extension/blob/3a4a06311f79d64ace5a5c5e7de9fcb36303b123/src/common/lib/crypto.ts).\n\nI had to clean the functions quite a bit so that they would run in Node, as well as install that \"*crypto-js*\" dependency, but it was worth it. It even took care of the Base64 encoding. By the way, the encryption seems to be AES-256 with a salt. So that's pretty secure.\n\nDecryption yielded the Nostr private key in hex form, with which I could derive the nsec and npub keypair and recover my Nostr account.\n\n**Be careful with your nostr keys - they're like Bitcoin Core keys. Hard to write down and better off in a password manager.**\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/fe77fd8ae70777dc13ba16d2c1ec5a1a0f77145b0921a1f9a4be9da8c4408301.png\"\u003e","sig":"03e7b4151f10493a6eec5282bffe852085004efee7d7f3d655b0fa3bca36d038cd69fb960a7f755d36fe7965a6115b3a242950e9c84d13d4c6d80fbbf36f5357"},"naddr1qq5y66trdp5kwctw94pxjarrda5kut2sdakxjcme94ykuum5d9682ar995c8j6mpddhqzrthwden5te0dehhxtnvdakqygxufusxe9k4csgerev2qdzvnp9044v8z44dz5rw6whjtfsguzny6gpsgqqqw4rs0ecfwy":{"kind":30023,"id":"6b8a0957f21594f07826fe7bdc2ffae4f73c4e105f89ddb0799661df126f47cd","pubkey":"dc4f206c96d5c41191e58a0344c984afad587156ad1506ed3af25a608e0a64d2","created_at":1741896315,"tags":[["image","https://blossom.primal.net/2637356e197ebb4bcb9cad0b107a500ab9f671ec13498c0384381bf715357ebe.jpg"],["summary","Position Statement on Recent Michigan House Bills Related to Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin"],["title","Michigan Bitcoin Policy Institute"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","reserve"],["t","mining"],["t","crypto"],["t","nostr"],["t","strategic"],["t","Bitcoin"],["t","policy"],["published_at","1741896315"],["d","Michigan-Bitcoin-Policy-Institute-0ykakn"]],"content":"The Michigan Bitcoin Policy Institute is committed to promoting sound money policies and fostering a supportive environment for Bitcoin in Michigan. In light of the recent house bills related to cryptocurrency, digital asset mining, and Bitcoin, we would like to share our insights and position on these important matters.\n\n#### HB 4085: Promoting a Level Playing Field for Miners\n\nWe strongly support HB 4085, which aims to create a level playing field for Bitcoin miners by treating them similarly to data centers. This bill allows miners to operate without discrimination, potentially creating new job opportunities and attracting significant investment to the state. However, we recommend amending the bill to remove the minimum power consumption requirement for defining a 'digital asset mining business.' This threshold could stifle innovation and prevent smaller, more agile mining operations from setting up in Michigan. By removing this requirement, Michigan can create a more welcoming environment for businesses of all sizes, from small startups to large-scale operations. Smaller miners can utilize stranded energy sources, aid in energy curtailment situations, and help drive economic growth, making Michigan a hub for Bitcoin mining.\n\n#### HB 4086: Concerns About MICHcoin\n\nWe have significant concerns about HB 4086, which proposes a precious metals-backed currency called MICHcoin. The issues surrounding metal auditability, true value, scarcity, stock-to-flow arbitrage between different metals, and storage/ transportation security are substantial. These concerns could lead to unintended consequences for Michigan taxpayers. There are many ETFs available that are backed by precious metals and regulated by the SEC, which can serve the same purpose. Therefore, we do not support this bill.\n\n#### HB 4087: Michigan Cryptocurrency Strategic Reserve\n\nWhile HB 4087 is advertised as a \"Michigan Bitcoin Strategic Reserve,\" it fails to mention Bitcoin specifically and instead references cryptocurrency. We are alarmed by the potential for loaning out the underlying assets, which could lead to a fractional reserve system. Historical examples have shown that such systems can be prone to catastrophic failures when a large number of claimants attempt to redeem their assets simultaneously. The risk of a 'bank run' or a collapse of the system is very real, and we fear that Michigan taxpayers could be left holding the bag.\n\nWe believe that Bitcoin's unique properties make it the only suitable choice for such a reserve. Bitcoin is a decentralized, open-source, and censorship-resistant form of money that operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing for direct transactions between parties without the need for intermediaries. Its decentralized nature is ensured by a global network of nodes and miners, who work together to validate and record transactions on a public ledger called the timechain/ blockchain. This decentralized architecture makes it virtually impossible for any single entity to control or manipulate the Bitcoin network, ensuring that it remains censorship-free and accessible to all. Furthermore, Bitcoin's limited supply and predictable monetary policy make it a sound money.\n\nWe would support a revised version of this bill that prioritizes Michigan's self-custody of Bitcoin **only**, in a secure, air-gapped, and multi-signature solution. This approach would allow the state to benefit from the unique properties of Bitcoin while minimizing the risks associated with third-party custodians or exchange-traded products.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAs we have recently seen at the federal level, Bitcoin has its own designated reserve because of its unique properties. The Michigan Bitcoin Policy Institute is committed to engaging in open and respectful dialogue with policymakers to ensure that Bitcoin policies in Michigan are informed by a nuanced understanding of Bitcoin and its characteristics. We are willing to dedicate time to discussing these matters further with relevant parties to inform policy decisions that benefit the Taxpayers of the State of Michigan.\n\nWe appreciate your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your service to the State of Michigan Taxpayers.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichigan Bitcoin Policy Institute\n\n# Links to bills:\n\nhttps://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2025-2026/billintroduced/House/pdf/2025-HIB-4085.pdf\n\nhttps://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2025-2026/billintroduced/House/pdf/2025-HIB-4086.pdf\n\nhttps://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2025-2026/billintroduced/House/pdf/2025-HIB-4087.pdf","sig":"06357d20de5376b31ebcfeb477a11e909241dea0846f3b3a17bd0c9cdd7c69627da4f86af4d5c37a97c01da4f86ba2a57c5c8e342a9ea96985d126c173f9fe98"},"naddr1qq5y6nzn94hhvetj948x7um5wgknyvnwvsk5vetzwf6kzune95erqv3494kkvdtgxfssz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzq9eemymaerqvwdc25f6ctyuvzx0zt3qld3zp5hf5cmfc2qlrzdh0qvzqqqr4gu784npy":{"kind":30023,"id":"cef2e390315468479e287585125a32f79df3eac1d3d41032b92077b4e5c5b5c7","pubkey":"1739d937dc8c0c7370aa27585938c119e25c41f6c441a5d34c6d38503e3136ef","created_at":1740235877,"tags":[["title","MLS over Nostr - 22nd February 2025"],["summary","Oh hello.

In my last update, I shared that I was sure MLS on Nostr was going to work and shared an early demo of the app. What a long time ago that seems now.\n\nThe big news is that White Noise is no longer just a demo. It's a real app. You can [download the alpha release](https://github.com/erskingardner/whitenoise/releases) and run it for yourself on MacOS, Linux, or Android. iOS TestFlight is coming soon. Keep in mind that it's still very much alpha software; a lot is changing and I wouldn't recommend using it for anything serious quite yet.\n\nWe've been busy. In my last update, I shared that I was sure MLS on Nostr was going to work and shared an early demo of the app. What a long time ago that seems now.\n\n## Vision\n\nBefore we get to the detailed project updates, I wanted to share a bit of my vision for White Noise.\n\nMore and more; freedom of speech, freedom of association, and privacy are under attack. Just this week, Apple was forced to remove their iCloud advanced encryption feature for all UK citizens because the UK government demanded that Apple build a backdoor to allow access to customer data. The EU continues to push \"Chat Control\" legislation that would force companies to remove end-to-end encryption from their platforms. And governments across the world are enforcing draconian \"hate speech\" laws that criminalize speech that offends or upsets.\n\nThe freedom to express ourselves and discuss difficult topics is a critical precondition for maintaining a healthy society. Without the ability to assert ideas and argue their merits vigorously we have no way of making progress or creating a civil society based on shared values and goals. Ironically, the very laws and regulations that many western governments are enforcing to \"protect\" us are eroding and destroying the most free and innovative societies in history.\n\nWhite Noise is to built to protect our freedom to gather, to express ourselves, and to discuss difficult topics. It's free and open source; anyone can fork the code and we'll never charge money to use it. It runs on a free and open source protocol; your identity and social graph is yours to own and control. You don't have to trust us with your data, everything is end-to-end encrypted and metadata is next to non-existent. We don't even run any servers, so government data requests will forever fall on deaf ears.\n\nWe want to build the fastest, most secure and private, and the most usable messenger in the world. Whether you want to use it to plan a family BBQ or overthrow a tyrant, White Noise should give you the tools you need to make it happen.\n\nIf you find this compelling and want to help, please consider contributing to the project or donating.\n\n## Progress\n\nAlright, let's talk about where we're at with the project.\n\n### Current functionality\n\n- Multiple accounts. You can login, or create, many different Nostr accounts in the app.\n- Search your nostr contact list, search for users you don't follow, or add contacts using an npub or hex public key.\n- Create DM groups. Right now, you can only create chats with a single other user. Under the hood, these DMs are actually groups, I just haven't added the UI for adding/removing users and managing the group.\n- Send messages, reply to messages, and add reactions. As you would expect from a messenging app.\n- View group information.\n- Settings that allows you to manage your accounts, relays, and other app settings.\n\n### Upcoming\n\n- An amazing hackathon group from [Bitcoin++ in Brasil](https://btcplusplus.dev/conf/floripa) has recently [added NWC](https://github.com/erskingardner/whitenoise/pull/89) (nostr wallet connect) support to the app. Paste lightning invoices into chats and they'll become QR codes that you can scan or pay them with a single click in the conversation! This will be in the next release.\n- Add support for encrypted media in chats using [Blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/tree/master). We'll start with images, but plan to add video, audio messages, and documents soon.\n- Groups with more than two users. We'll add the ability to add/remove users and manage the group. This will also include some upgrades to further improve the forward secrecy of group chats.\n- iOS TestFlight. Gated app stores suck. We'll get White Noise on iOS into TestFlight as soon as possible.\n\n## Links\n\n- [The repo](https://github.com/erskingardner/whitenoise)\n- [Releases](https://github.com/erskingardner/whitenoise/releases)\n- [Previous updates](https://highlighter.com/jeffg.fyi)","sig":"bdff847591e5b763b4ce369a1d2714b318bdd158cc88b569815ade4b2adfc6c4eb07151e78b87be5358cb9c018a295b01c3e6fa679dd66956f8ee2bdcc9033bd"},"naddr1qq5yun6n23fz6ann9428yctyd96xjmmwv9kz65m0vd5kzmpdf4jkg6tp94k8z7nfv95sz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzqdu9vtxjppyaecahfkzmc0njep8c4dv7jj4zjegwrtgmg7n0cemnqvzqqqr4gu4qlv3a":{"kind":30023,"id":"d9db37b5f8f5ea5030a0e8076d056739be803b6af30e82fc69ea5f00b1afd933","pubkey":"378562cd20849dce3b74d85bc3e72c84f8ab59e94aa29650e1ad1b47a6fc6773","created_at":1740069311,"tags":[["title","NOSTR vs. Traditional Social Media"],["summary","A New Class of Social Experience"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/d674bc4687d7fd953d0889f5bcf6da2fe3f6bff515949bf5e58230b92f5392fb.webp"],["t","nostr"],["t","decentralized social media"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","censorship resistance"],["t","free speech"],["t","open-source"],["t","web3"],["t","privacy"],["t","digital freedom"],["t","social media revolution"],["published_at","1740069311"],["d","NOSTR-vs-Traditional-Social-Media-lqziai"]],"content":"In the ever-evolving landscape of social media, platforms like Twitter and Facebook have dominated the space for years. They’ve shaped the way we interact, share, and consume information. But as censorship concerns, algorithmic manipulation, and corporate control over data become more apparent, a new contender has emerged—NOSTR (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays). The differences are striking for those who have stepped into the NOSTR ecosystem. Let’s dive into what sets it apart and why it’s more than just another social media platform—**it’s a movement**.\n\n### **Decentralization vs. Corporate Control**\n\nThe fundamental structure is one of the most noticeable differences between NOSTR and traditional platforms like Twitter or Facebook. Both are owned by massive corporations that dictate what can and cannot be said. They collect data, sell advertisements, and use algorithms to curate what users see.\n\nNOSTR, on the other hand, is fully decentralized. No single entity controls the platform, no shadowy moderation teams tweak visibility based on corporate interests, and no risk of being permanently banned by a faceless algorithm. Instead, NOSTR operates on an open protocol, allowing anyone to participate without gatekeepers. Your content is truly yours, and no one can take that away from you.\n\n### **A Different Class of People**\n\nScrolling through Twitter or Facebook often feels like wading through a digital battlefield. Political flame wars, mind-numbing clickbait, and attention-seeking outrage dominate the feeds. While both platforms do have intelligent and well-meaning users, they are drowned out by noise, bots, and engagement-hacking algorithms designed to fuel division.\n\nNOSTR, by contrast, attracts a different breed of users—people who value free speech, independent thought, and meaningful conversation. Many of them are builders, thinkers, and pioneers eager to create a better way of interacting online. There’s a noticeable shift in tone; rather than content driven by controversy and outrage, you’ll find people discussing innovation, philosophy, and real-world solutions. Conversations feel more organic, unfiltered, and free from the artificial constraints imposed by big tech algorithms.\n\n### **Similarities Exist But With a Better Foundation**\n\nAt a glance, using a NOSTR client may seem similar to traditional social media platforms. Users post messages (called ‘notes’), interact with others, and build followings. You can reply, share, and engage much like you would on Twitter. But under the hood, everything operates on a more open, transparent system.\n\nInstead of relying on centralized servers controlled by corporations, NOSTR functions through relays—public or private servers that transmit messages. Since there’s no corporate overlord dictating what gets priority in your feed, you see content chronologically and unfiltered. Additionally, identity and reputation are built through cryptographic keys rather than being at the mercy of a username that a platform can seize or shadowban at will.\n\n### **No Ads, No Tracking, No Manipulation**\n\nLet’s be honest—traditional social media has become a giant advertisement machine. Everything is optimized to keep you engaged just long enough to serve more ads and collect more data. Your feed isn’t showing you what’s most relevant; it’s showing you what makes the company the most money.\n\nNOSTR eliminates this problem entirely. There are no forced ads, no trackers collecting your data, and no algorithm deciding what you should see. Instead, users fund relays or tip content creators directly, creating an ecosystem that values people over profit.\n\n### **For New Users: A Starting Point**\n\nIf you’re new to NOSTR, welcome! I’m still a beginner myself, but I’ve already seen the potential this platform has to change how we connect online. Getting started can seem overwhelming at first, but there are a few key tools and resources that can help smooth the transition.\n\nFor a great user-friendly NOSTR client, **Damus** (for iOS) and **Amethyst** (for Android) are excellent places to start. If you prefer a web-based option, **Primal.net** offers a simple and intuitive experience. These platforms make it easy to dive in, start posting, and get a feel for how NOSTR operates.\n\nBut NOSTR isn’t just about social media—it’s a foundation for something bigger. Developers and innovators are expanding their reach beyond simple note-sharing. Specialized communities and applications are already emerging, including platforms for **photography, recipe sharing, and even swap sites**, all built using the NOSTR framework. The possibilities are growing, and the future looks bright.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThe shift from Twitter or Facebook to NOSTR isn’t just about switching platforms; it’s about embracing a fundamentally better way to communicate online. With decentralization, real freedom of expression, and a community of forward-thinking individuals, NOSTR offers an experience that traditional social media simply cannot match.\n\nFor those seeking a place where ideas flow freely, where profit-driven algorithms don’t dictate engagement, and where you control your own digital presence, NOSTR is not just an alternative. It’s an upgrade.\n\nLet's connect and learn together!\n\nnpub1x7zk9nfqsjwuuwm5mpdu8eevsnu2kk0ff23fv58p45d50fhuvaeszg44p2\n\nprimal.net/Goody","sig":"cdfe9603e62ec18ae5fccbb6e2228e67e2467353a3c5a6a33384b966de39a5fe25ebfd4d6d78f7ad58f206a6d9b29b44016a157573eaa30121a554efe2cbe707"},"naddr1qq64g6r994qhyapddanz6ntpdd5kueedg3jkx6tnd9hkuuedw35xzapdf9khqctrwsk57argv4e8xttjwg68jctdqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyq0nee3wq4slynsxq20r5l3l8w7u66rqh2rrzlrxus8e9kmwddwcxqcyqqq823c4shk8v":{"kind":30023,"id":"5d99bb0ece203500fb7276b20bccb9861d62a7c9af9fcf8cc0f1336f3c880389","pubkey":"1f3ce62e0561f24e06029e3a7e3f3bbdcd6860ba86317c66e40f92db6e6b5d83","created_at":1740572451,"tags":[["image","https://blossom.primal.net/04d682a4435226cc16bd1393c0adb7cb06d4cec106fc63e7c12bdc0f0ac06dfe.jpg"],["title","The Art of Making Decisions that Impact Others"],["summary","Everyone in a team makes decisions that impact others.

If you are not in a leadership position, I would like to invite you to identify those decisions you make that impact your team. If you are a leader, it might be easier for you.\n\n\\\nSeeing how our decisions have an impact over others, requires to put ourselves on someone else shoes first. Empathy is a human quality underrated these days. That is why I don'92t think it is a matter of being a leader or not. Any role at the workplace requires empathy, not because of the role, but because we are humans.\n\n\\\nI like to use empathy as a way of introducing a concept that I will described in the next chapter, **the whole self.**\n\n\\\nWhen we connect with empathy, we start exploring what we called **#emotionalIntelligence**. This type of intelligence is something unique, that only humans can develop over any machine. Our emotions and the intelligence emerging from them are a human super power, and we haven't explored as its full potential yet.\n\n\\\nAs changes emerge everyday, as machines expand their role in society, we are all invited to explore those human capabilities that make us unique. Capabilities that we haven't explored deeply yet. Emotional intelligence is one of them.\n\n\\\nExpressing emotions or using them as an intelligence aspect is not common at work. Most of our roles are purely rational, logic and sequential. Facts and numbers don't give a room for emotional intelligence. While in my view, they can work together.\n\n\\\n**We usually use numbers and facts to make decisions, and use the same rational intelligence to execute them 🤔**\n\n\\\nLet's use an example. Your client is arguing with you about how the cost of the project got over the planned numbers. He is very anger and eventually that emotion triggers in you the same emotion, because you have been working so many hours on this project, just to get the client focused only on what is not working instead of what it is.\n\n\\\n**Emotions without emotional intelligence are contagious**. You can imagine how an argue like this can end. Everyone gets more frustrated than when started. Nothing got really solved in a conversation like this.\n\n**\\\nThis frustration and anger goes with you and your client to your homes and families get impacted with it**. Kids slept badly and had a bad day at school. They might misbehaved at school and another kid might be impacted from it. The other kid's mom gets worried about your kid and her kid interaction that day and she brings that worry into another home and family. And so on.\n\n\\\nLet's start again. You client is arguing with you about how the cost of the project got over the planned numbers. **This time you decided to use** your unique human capability, **emotional intelligence**, specifically **empathy** 🩷\n\n\\\nYou keep silence and just listen to the argument. By **paying attention at the words being used and the gestures** you realized this person is under a lot of stress. By going deeper in your listening, your intuition can tell, there is something else going on.\n\n\\\nWhen the person stop complaining, you bring back the story told by your client, adding the emotions you could feel while listening. **You put yourself in your client shoes**.\n\n\\\nIt is inevitable that, when we approach a situation with emotions, the person connects immediately with them. **The client feels listened and emotionally connected with you**. From there, you start exploring what else is going on, from a genuine point of view. The conversation goes in deep and you both find you are going under a lot of stress for things at work and at your personal level.\n\n\\\nYou both decide to talk about this issue the next day, with a refresh mind and a common goal, to find a solution for both.\n\n\\\nAs you can see, **there is a totally different impact of making a decision of using or not using your emotional intelligence capability**. \n\n**🌱 And this example could apply to a leader or a team member. 🌱**\n\n**🌱Everyone in a team makes decisions that impact others. And emotional intelligence is not only for leaders. 🌱**\n\n\\\nThis simple example wants to bring awareness about how important is to explore emotional intelligence as individuals and expand it a teams, organizations and companies levels.\n\n\\\n**We can't bring emotional intelligence to work, if we, as individuals, don't feel comfortable to connect with our own emotions**. \n\n**Empathy requires us to stay fully (and sometimes uncomfortably) connected with emotions.** That requires another important aspect of emotional intelligence **which is our capability of staying present, self aware of our body and what is triggering frustration, anger or sadness as a result of an external stimulus**.\n\n\\\n**As our environments keep changing on daily basis, our brains are invited to create new neuron connections**, this process triggers emotions under the unexpected. \n\nOur capability to connect with your emotions and managing them in our favor can make this adventure of navigating change, easier for us and the people around. \\\n\\\n**And it is bringing a new self at work, your personal one**. Who comes with all your professional expertise as well as your unique capabilities as a human.\n\n\\\n**Let's explore in our next chapter how this personal self is emerging at workplaces and by integrating it with your professional self, can bring your whole self at workplaces.**\n\n**By using LEGOs we can bring new perspectives, deep listening and spark more creative solutions.**\n\nSo step by step, we made our workplaces more human.\n\n**Deep listening breaks down walls.**\n\n**And that is what The World 🌎 strongly needs these days.**\n\nStay colorful, \\\nLaus\n\n#nostr #Consciousness #grownostr #emocionalintelligence #leadership #consciousleadership #emotions #decisionmaking #DeepListening #Teambuilding #clientservice #PlayingLegos #Legos","sig":"a7d8d044046ab64bc1789d13fafa187d8ebc9ad88b2dd172082d6c88770ebfae982f21a3832766fb83c51fe1bd49c27cc8dcb3717f398bd3279cc5a059edb073"},"naddr1qq656mm4de6xz6twwvk566twv3ej6ctwvsk56etpde5kueed235x2t2nvd5k2mnrv5kk7e3dg9mk2tf409uhw7fsqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qwxjt0lu9nlxcxxyghy8gyq6ejhjxu29fhayremsvarn4d5qfdy4qxpqqqp65w3g5rm3":{"kind":30023,"id":"2cb752b01ca850a7ba4855cb920e1430077f40fb31f6bc8d291babf8f522befc","pubkey":"71a4b7ff859fcd831888b90e82035995e46e28a9bf483cee0ce8e756d009692a","created_at":1737048666,"tags":[["summary","A brief reflection based on research into the awe experience: its connection to physiology, health, and hiking"],["title","Mountains, Minds, and Meaning: The Science of Awe"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/278e13f650c7e5f9f338d3e3d281718f3131dea59398e5ed01cd770f6dcb3b3e.jpg"],["t","psychology"],["t","awe"],["t","philosophy"],["t","hiking"],["t","backpacking"],["t","mountains"],["t","mind"],["t","science"],["t","nostr"],["t","grownostr"],["t","plebchain"],["t","mountainchain"],["t","outdoorstr"],["t","hikechain"],["t","reads"],["t","goodreads"],["t","mohetiale"],["published_at","1737048666"],["d","Mountains-Minds-and-Meaning-The-Science-of-Awe-5yywy0"]],"content":"A couple of years ago psychologists at Berkeley have [delved into the phenomenon of awe](https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916221094856)—how it affects us, when it arises, and how it can benefit us. Then I made this short summary, which I translated and edited a little today.\n\n## What Characterizes Awe?\n\nResearchers define awe as a distinct and complex emotion encompassing 8–10 positive feelings, such as wonder, admiration, delight, and respect.\n\nI’d like to sprinkle in a touch of discomfort or even threat, but the study notes that this aspect of awe depends on cultural context. For instance, in Japan, awe is more closely tied to experiences of threat than in other countries—think earthquakes, emperors, Hiroshima, Godzilla, and other kaiju.\n\n## How does our body respond to awe?\n\nIt turns out that awe can significantly improve both physical and mental health—even in “angry, bald apes” like us. The only caveat is not to mix it with fear or threat. Awe associated with those tends to be less beneficial.\n\nThe study identifies five key ways in which awe supports well-being:\n\n1. **Neurophysiological bonuses**:\n\n   - Increased vagal tone.\n   - Reduced sympathetic arousal.\n   - Release of oxytocin.\n   - Decreased systemic inflammation.\n   - Lower activity in the brain’s default mode network.\n\n2. **Reduced self-focus**:\\\n   Over-focusing on oneself contributes to anxiety, depression, body image issues, addiction, aggression, and more. Notably, most people's profile pictures are close-ups of their faces. But among hikers, you’re more likely to see tiny figures dwarfed by vast, beautiful landscapes. If that’s not a literal shift away from self-focus, what is?\n\n3. **Prosociality**:\\\n   Even a brief moment of awe boosts cooperation, generosity, and altruistic behavior. Nowhere have I seen as much mutual help and free-flowing communication, even among strangers, as I have on hiking trips.\n\n4. **Connection to the larger whole**:\\\n   Awe fosters integration into strong social networks, a sense of connection to others, and harmony with nature.\n\n5. **A sense of meaning, purpose, and significance**:\\\n   Awe aids in making sense of life’s events, finding links between the present and the past, and aligning with one’s values, relationships, and life trajectory.\n\nThese five aspects form the foundation of both physical and mental health. Open any book, lecture, or treatise on human well-being, and you’ll find them highlighted in some form.\n\n## How can you experience awe?\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/46f89c89063c95b68833651fd09566613a9cf7e5b79f3fd4107e690d3a7d7242.jpg\"\u003e\n\nThe good news is that opportunities to experience awe are varied and accessible to almost everyone. It’s both surprising and heartening that they don’t revolve around the modern-day idols of success, money, or power. It seems that, at our core, we’re geared toward other goals and often misled by false priorities.\n\nAmong the universally effective ways to experience awe, researchers highlight:\n\n- Spiritual and religious practices.\n- Shared ceremonies (cinema, music, dance).\n- Visual art.\n- Psychedelic experiences.\n- Acts of courage and kindness (which inspire awe in others).\n- And, of course, connection with nature.\n\nWhen mountains and hiking entered my life, they brought more health, peace, friends, purpose, and meaning than I’d ever expected. This text is a direct result of the awe I feel each time I stand among peaks, cliffs, forests, lakes, and rivers.\n\nIt’s not a panacea, but in a time when we’re drowning in useless information, political madness, urban filth, and noise, we desperately need a breath of fresh air.\n\nLet’s embrace awe!\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/d2e3c29b06c3eb963005429494a1687fba8dc32eed8deb56e3650fdf2472cc39.jpg\"\u003e","sig":"92a2ceea0e5fcbbce017c15b7d572cabeb14c8304dfbb36ef8768c925164204c7ba07b71886d4df93215235aaea56e5d861ec9999206d532f6e87bca0c29dcf1"},"naddr1qq6hxmmkv4ex26t8de68jtt5dpex7at8dqsx6ct5dpjk6ct5d93hxgrrdpshqar9wgsrww3qdphkcerfdenjqmmwqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyzletcdyt027ch9q6ss0fa2u6qtyt3uynatlm5fm33d0a38tmnyysqcyqqq823chj4znl":{"kind":30023,"id":"c83a2c95b62c66114912a189f35bd94e4a6967ad9d8f7a7d43b462486ab3f633","pubkey":"bf95e1a45bd5ec5ca0d420f4f55cd01645c7849f57fdd13b8c5afec4ebdcc848","created_at":1746180055,"tags":[["title","Sovereignty Through Mathematics Chapter 7: Holding On"],["summary","Bitcoin Infinity Academy - Course 1 Part 8"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/5f025e6941b046cd7fa43876f5cc2573ac6736648d7568c8f6f270450629e7a8.png"],["published_at","1746180055"],["d","sovereignty-through mathematics chapter 7: holding on"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","nostr"],["t","philosophy"],["t","books"],["r","wss://feeds.nostr.band/audio"],["r","wss://nrelay.c-stellar.net/"],["r","wss://purplepag.es/"],["r","wss://relay.nostr.band/"],["r","wss://relay.primal.net/"],["r","wss://nostr.wine/"],["r","wss://filter.nostr.wine/"],["r","wss://nostr-relay.algotech.io/"],["client","Primal"]],"content":"This is a part of the Bitcoin Infinity Academy course on Knut Svanholm's book Bitcoin: Sovereignty Through Mathematics.

We chopped wood and salted meat in order to survive. In our current age of consumerism, however, we’ve forgotten all that and we pilgrim to the shopping malls as much as everyone else. No one seems to even have a savings account anymore. Interest rates are low, and we’re told to borrow and spend as much as we can. We’re bombarded with advertising for loans, mortgages, and financial services on a daily basis. Why? Because of our inability to understand the nature of money and its mechanics. Inflation is the underlying force that makes us squander rather than save. Inflation hinders us from reaping the fruits of our labor whenever we see fit, and it makes that very fruit rot. Bitcoin reverses the rotting process and provides us with a means of transporting the value of our labor not only through space but also through time.\n\nThe Stanford Marshmallow Experiments was a series of studies on delayed gratification conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In these experiments, children were given a marshmallow or a cookie and were told that they would receive an additional one if they could control their urges and not touch the first one for fifteen minutes. Follow-up studies found that the kids who were able to resist the temptation of the first cookie tended to score better on SAT tests, have lower BMIs, and higher incomes than their less disciplined counterparts. Investing in your future self — in other words, resisting present temptation by delaying gratification — is the most effective skill you can cultivate for a brighter future. You reap what you sow. This can be described as having a low time preference. Having a low time preference is a fundamental factor in the economic success of any human endeavor. Not trying to catch fish with your hands for a couple of days in order to construct a rod or net when on a deserted island might make you hungry during those sacrificed days, but it will provide a better chance of catching fish in the future. Likewise, learning new skills now might lead to a higher salary in the future. Unfortunately, our current monetary system distorts our perceptions and incentives and favors those with a higher time preference — those who spend rather than save. We’re at a different point in history than the above-mentioned marooned fisherman. \"Give a man a fish and feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and feed him for a lifetime,\" the saying goes. The ultimate goal should be to teach mankind to teach itself how to fish. What our current paradigm endorses is “give a man enough distractions, and he will stop thinking about finding better ways to support his loved ones and will succumb to whatever narrative you fill his head with, to make him work for you through taxes and inflation instead of for himself.”\n\nIn Bitcoin, people with a low time preference win. If you can resist the urge to sell, you will be rewarded in the future. The Bitcoin community refers to not selling as HODLing, which originated when a [bitcointalk.org](http://bitcointalk.org) forumer named GameKyuubi misspelled the word *holding* in a now-famous post titled \"I AM HODLING.\" The post became one of the Bitcoin community’s most prominent memes and a battle cry to resist the urge to sell during bear markets. Bitcoiners who have decided never to sell most or all of their holdings are referred to as *HODLers of last resort*. This term is not to be confused with the central banking term *lender of last resort*. The yearly highs in the price of Bitcoin are arguably less interesting than the yearly lows, which are practically decided by these HODLers of last resort. Considering its limited supply, all that Bitcoin needs to keep rising in price over the medium and long term are these people. Adoption and other metrics of measuring the success of Bitcoin are all dwarfed by the currency’s remarkable rise in value since its inception. The price has increased by a factor of ten approximately every three years. The best guarantee we have that it will keep doing so is Bitcoin’s limited supply combined with the HODLers of last resort.\n\nIn the Bitcoin space, and even more so in the cryptocurrency space on the whole, there’s a lot of talk about usage and adoption. We’re shown metrics of trading volumes and merchant acceptance, and we’re led to believe that these correlate with the short and long-term value in one way or another. While there may be truth in some of these theories, the most basic function of a deflationary asset is overlooked and rarely mentioned — the elephant in the room, so to speak. The best use for a commodity as scarce as Bitcoin is not to spend it or even to trade it but to save it and hold it for as long as you can. By doing so, you limit the number of coins in circulation. The more people that do this, the harder it will be to come by and the higher its price will be. Nothing on Earth is as scarce as Bitcoin. Nothing is as irreplicable, as immutable, and at the same time as portable as Bitcoin — its unique history and resistance to change have already proven this over and over. Its absolute scarcity is what gives Bitcoin its value, and ironically enough, this seems to be the hardest thing for people to understand about it. What if everyone in the network became a HODLer and decided to never sell, wouldn’t the network just slowly come to a halt? Not at all. Everyone has a price. Few would resist selling some of their Bitcoin if it could buy them a small city. There are price levels for each HODLer where reallocating financially may be a wise thing to do. A Bitcoin is also very divisible: The smallest unit, the *satoshi*, sometimes referred to as a *sat*, is one-hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. Even smaller units are made possible with the introduction of the Lightning Network, albeit not in the actual Bitcoin blockchain. Together, this enables Bitcoin to be highly saleable even at astronomical price levels.\n\nWhat not having sound money has done to us is simply unfathomable. Imagine every person on Earth knowing that every transaction they’ll ever make will have a real impact on their future prosperity. We’re so used to inflationary currencies that most people don’t even realize why sound money is important. We’re so used to having a large cut of our income silently taken away from us that we don’t even realize how much of our day we spend working for someone else. Wars are funded by inflation. Imagine how many man-hours were put in by people who didn’t realize they were actually working for a war machine funded by a corrupt currency during World War II. Every time you use a fiat currency, you legitimize counterfeiting. Every time you use Bitcoin, you promote sound money. In fact, every time you don’t use your Bitcoin but save it instead, you promote sound money because sound money increases in value when the total number of coins in circulation is limited. It all sounds a bit magic and far-fetched, doesn’t it? Increased value over time, no matter what happens? Well, that is why many of us so-called Bitcoin Maximalists are so excited that we put our careers at risk for this technology. Once you realize what Bitcoin is and what it will do for the world, there is no way of un-realizing it. It really is mind-blowing.\n\nAt the beginning of time-that-actually-is-money — in other words, around 2009 — Bitcoin was mostly considered a toy for the cypherpunk movement. As its price started to grow rapidly, a small group of early investors became very wealthy, which in turn spawned a media hype around the phenomenon. Mainstream media remained largely skeptical, portraying Bitcoin as a pyramid scheme, a tulip craze, or a bubble at best. Most journalists simply couldn’t understand how an asset seemingly created out of thin air could have any long-term relevance. Some were frustrated because they thought that they’d missed the train. Many still do. In a world where companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon can rise from zero to world dominance in a decade, people tried to find the Next Big Thing — the next Bitcoin. This attracted charlatans and scammers to the field who launched hundreds of altcoins, claiming to someday be technically superior, faster, or more privacy-focused. What the snake-oil salespeople omitted were the crucial facts: their new coins and tokens were not decentralized (and therefore neither immutable nor censorship-resistant), did not have a fair distribution, and so on. What most people still don’t get is that if Bitcoin doesn’t work, nothing will. This is humanity’s best shot at sound money. It is also, very likely, our only shot at it.\n\nMany venture capital firms, hedge funds, and retail investors were bamboozled by the buzzword frenzy and invested great sums in these quack tokens. This generated confusion in the market as many altcoins increased dramatically in price at an even higher rate than Bitcoin. Due to human nature and a lack of understanding of basic monetary economics, the bubble grew bigger and bigger until it inevitably popped and wiped out most of the useless alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin experienced ups and downs as well, but they were less volatile. Bitcoin bottomed at levels well above the beginning of the previous bull run and then resumed rising just as it had done several times before. The victims of the altcoin craze will take note of this. They will learn the hard way what separates the original from the copycat. They will see the undisputable superiority of sound money. It’s just a matter of time. Time, which is money.\n\nEvery time the people of Venezuela, Turkey, Argentina, or Zimbabwe are screwed over by their respective central banking authorities and turn to Bitcoin to preserve their savings or income from rampant inflation, the world becomes more aware of Bitcoin as a store of value. In comparison to the Venezuelan Bolivar, there was no crash in Bitcoin at all. There’s also a good chance the really big players will accumulate aggressively during the next bull market, given that Bitcoin, for the moment, still represents a very small allocation of institutional and hedge fund investment. Consider what will happen when institutional investors and a growing number of larger nations start to see Bitcoin’s potentially limitless upside. At this point, central banks will start to accumulate Bitcoin in an attempt to keep up with reality. This will legitimize the technology even further.\n\nIt is still unclear when this will all play out. When it does, however, it will be the largest transfer of wealth from one medium to another in human history. Early investors, many of which are technically competent, will become financially independent and, therefore, able to contribute to the ecosystem full-time. More and more people will demand payment in Bitcoin for its ability to store value. Remember that the next block reward halving is just around the corner and that Bitcoin will have an even greater stock-to-flow ratio than gold in just a few years. After the halving in 2020, Bitcoin will have a supply inflation rate of approximately 1.8%, which is lower than the US Federal Reserve’s target 2% price inflation rate. It is important to remember that Bitcoin is still an experiment. Should the experiment work, however, hyperbitcoinization is just a matter of time.\n\nThe implications of giving everyone on Earth the ability to rot-proof the fruit of their labor and transport its value through time are hard to overstate. The closest thing we’ve had to it historically is gold, but gold is not very divisible and not very easy for the general public to get their hands on. More importantly, gold is not absolutely scarce. No one knows how much of it there is left buried in the Earth's crust. Investing in real estate has also been seen as a good store of value throughout the ages, but real estate needs a lot of maintenance and is not cheap to hold on to. Real estate is also relatively easy to confiscate in the event of political collapse. Bitcoin provides us with the potential ability to store any amount in our heads and pass it down through generations without anyone ever knowing we had it in the first place. It effectively endows each individual with the power possessed by the feudal kings to turn people into knights. Any bitcoiner can now dub any no-coiner into a fully-fledged time-proof bitcoiner.\n\n### **About the Bitcoin Infinity Academy**\n\nThe Bitcoin Infinity Academy is an educational project built around [Knut Svanholm](http://primal.net/knut)’s books about Bitcoin and Austrian Economics.

As a blockchain native since 2017, I've witnessed the evolution of decentralized technologies firsthand. Most of my professional career has been spent working within big tech companies, giving me a unique perspective on both centralized and decentralized systems.\n\nMy social media journey began on Twitter in 2007, where I've maintained a presence for over 17 years. I've also explored other decentralized social platforms including BlueSky, Farcaster, and Lens Protocol. As a Bitcoin maximalist, I was particularly intrigued by Nostr's compatibility with the Lightning Network, which initially drew me to the platform.\n\n## The Onboarding Challenge\n\nThe Nostr onboarding experience presents a significant hurdle for newcomers. Despite my technical background in blockchain technologies, I found the initial setup process more complicated than expected. Understanding public/private key cryptography just to join a social network creates a steeper learning curve than necessary.\n\nBlueSky and Farcaster have demonstrated that it's possible to maintain decentralized principles while providing a more streamlined onboarding experience. Their approaches show that user-friendly design and decentralization aren't mutually exclusive concepts.\n\n## Relay Management: Room for Improvement\n\nThe concept of relays represents one of Nostr's most distinctive features, though it can be confusing for newcomers. While many clients come pre-configured with default relays, users eventually encounter situations where content or connections seem inconsistent.\n\nWhen someone I've interacted with doesn't appear in my feed or doesn't respond, I'm often left wondering if we're simply on different relays. This uncertainty creates friction that doesn't exist on other platforms where connectivity is handled behind the scenes.\n\nThe relay system introduces a layer of complexity that, while important to Nostr's architecture, could benefit from better abstraction in the user experience. When using BlueSky or Farcaster, I don't need to think about the underlying infrastructure, something Nostr could learn from while maintaining its decentralized principles.\n\n## The Zap Economy: Growing Pains\n\nThe Lightning-powered zap system shows tremendous potential, but I've observed some concerning economic patterns. Longer-term Nostr users have expressed frustration about continuously sending zaps while seeing limited growth in the overall ecosystem.\n\nInterestingly, there appears to be a connection between this liquidity issue and community growth dynamics. Some established users who voice concerns about bearing the financial burden of the zapping economy are simultaneously less welcoming to newer accounts, rarely following, engaging with, or zapping newcomers.\n\nThis creates a challenging environment for new users, who face a cold reception and have little incentive to load their Lightning wallets or participate in the zap economy. Why bring fresh liquidity to a platform where established users rarely engage with your content? This dynamic has limited the expansion of the ecosystem, with the same sats often circulating among established users rather than growing with new participants.\n\n## Client Diversity: Strength and Challenge\n\nNostr's multiple client options offer users choice, which is valuable. However, the implementation of NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities) varies across clients, creating inconsistent experiences. Features that work seamlessly in one client might be implemented differently in another.\n\nThis extends to fundamental aspects like search functionality, thread navigation, and notification systems, all of which can differ significantly between clients. For users accustomed to consistent experiences, this fragmentation creates a learning curve with each new client they try.\n\n## Lightning Integration: Varying Experiences\n\nThe Lightning Network integration varies in quality and user experience across Nostr clients. While the functionality is generally present, the implementation quality, feature set, and ease of use differ depending on which client you choose.\n\nThis inconsistency means users may need to experiment with several clients to find one that provides the Lightning experience they're looking for, rather than having a consistent experience across the ecosystem.\n\n## Finding Balance\n\nNostr appears to be navigating the challenge of balancing technical innovation with user experience. While its cryptographic foundation and decentralized architecture are impressive technical achievements, these same strengths sometimes come at the cost of accessibility.\n\nDespite my technical background and interest in decentralized technologies, I find myself using BlueSky and Farcaster more frequently for daily social interactions, while checking Nostr less often. For Nostr to achieve its potential for broader adoption, addressing these user experience considerations while maintaining its core principles will be essential.\n\nThe platform has tremendous potential with improvements to user experience, community dynamics, and economic sustainability, Nostr could evolve from a fascinating technical experiment into a truly compelling alternative to mainstream social media.","sig":"de221c7cc594f6939eec35bf5df904020f17a4aaef1ab48210702b0abc12285f4fe767e9fb40780167f5e3da5748a37935762af5c84fe35fc449f232ea00bf63"},"naddr1qq8hw6re945k6tt0dckkummnw3eqzyrhwden5te0dehhxarj9emkjmn9qgsd73u9dpremcntf2pur0wymw4krdwvsts6xyhzk29us9dp9223uecrqsqqqa28nl4f4m":{"kind":30023,"id":"2f2dee36b6bf51267ffd6c8e22ce678f16c00498f9bf78e42cacd317c3ebd071","pubkey":"df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67","created_at":1736540136,"tags":[["d","why-im-on-nostr"],["title","Why I'm On Nostr"],["summary","I wrote about why I am on nostr.

It sounded like a promising alternative to legacy social media.\n\n![1a](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Amendment_1.jpg/2880px-Amendment_1.jpg)\n\nHere's the thing: Free speech does not exist. According to Rothbard in [The Ethics of Liberty](https://mises.org/library/book/ethics-liberty), the property owner always has the right to censor.(He gives the example, If you give a speech in a movie theater, the ushers will ask you to leave. The crowd might throw popcorn at you. Therefore you do not have the freedom of speech in a movie theater.  The proverbial, \"you don't have the right to yell fire in a crowded theater\" is a red-herring. The freedom of speech, not freedom of reach argument is another argument for censorship. The information super highway is owned and operated by corporations. It's 2025. I don't focus on stocks very much, but I've seen NVIDIA. The NVIDIA stock price is not the interesting part. The interesting part is how fast AI is becoming ubiquitous.\n\nThat means writing code is easier. That means a new Internet not built and controlled by corporations. It means development on this new protocol can be funded with donations to a non-profit corporation. Or people can send $1,000 to a corporation to help fund development and get a badge. It's almost like virtue signaling your support for development of an interesting bitcoin wallet. I know virtue signaling gets a bad rap, but it is virtuous to support the development of a bitcoin wallet built for a world where Social Media Apps can be banned by a government with a bill of rights that begins with the words: \n\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nI don't know if TikTok is something we should want to ban or not. I've never used it and have no dog in this fight. I'm not informed enough about the issue to give a useful opinion on the TikTok case, but I find it very interesting. Whatever the ruling, I will find the reasons behind the ruling most fascinating. Whatever they are, I would like to run a thought experiment. If the ban is not held constitutional, I want to know if this would set precedence for nostr. If it is the ban is held constitutional, how would this ruling apply to the nostr protocol? ** O am not a lawyer** and do not know the answers to any of these questions, but it's fun to think about.\n\n![nostr](https://www.0xkishan.com/blogs/nostr/nostr.png)\n\nNostr is unique because it cannot be owned by a corporation or communist government.  It is owned by individuals. Each individual who can afford it can own their own data. Your speech is attached to an npub that can be seen on every nostr client. It is stored on several relays. You can run your own relay. You can run your own client. In the very early days, we all had to be on the same relays to see the same posts, but the outbox model fixes this. It is still early days, but nostr has many implementation possibilities and I suspect the protocol to get better over time. \n\nPrimal  can still censor me. Since I run my own relay, I will not lose my content if they do. I may not be able to be see on the Primal App, but people will still be able to see me on Amethyst or Coracle. If Primal shadow bans me, I can still speak. I don’t think Primal will ban me, but even if the government knocked on Miljan’s door and made him an offer he can’t refuse, I can still speak on nostr. X, Facebook, or any other platform cannot grant the freedom of speech. You must follow their terms and conditions. The government goons can tell platforms to ban certain content by sending a single email. They have to wait on government permission. Mark Zuckerburg must know zaps exist when the United States government stopped him from printing his own stable coin. To ban a nostr user requires shutting down more than just one company or a law that bans a platform. It requires shutting down computers of individuals. It happens from time to time(The Canadian government sucks), but it would be difficult to ban all the computers running nostr.  It's not perfect. [John Carvalho wrote a great article](https://medium.com/pubky/pubky-the-next-web-3287b35408f1) about all the problems with these newfangled decentralized tools, but nostr looks promising.\n\n### Freedom Tech Gives Power To The People\n![Freedom Tech](https://gitea.marc26z.com/marc/NostrPhotos/raw/branch/main/freedomtech2/freedomtech2.png)\n\n\"I am fascinated by Tim May's crypt-anarchy. Unlike the communities\ntraditionally associated with the word \"anarchy\", in a crypt-anarchy the\ngovernment is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and\npermanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is\nimpotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible\nbecause its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical\nlocations.\"\n- wei dai, b-money\n\nNostr is not quite crypto-anarchy, but it is freedom tech. Nostr is free from corporations. This doesn't mean there are no corporations involved on nostr. Much of the funding is funded by a 5013c corporation. Primal is a corporation, but Primal is a small fraction of nostr. Social media is a fraction of [nostr awesomeness](https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr).  It's participants can almost all be linked to their true identity unless they have Satoshi-esque OPsec skills. Nostr does not remove the threat of government violence, but it increases the censorship hash-rate. It will take more work to censor people on nostr than simply sending an email to Zuck or whatever they do.\nRunning your own relay and client is not too difficult. For a few hundred thousand sats and a little elbow grease, you can own your own speech and broadcast from your own computer. It's like owning your own movie theater. You are free to yell fire in your own movie theater. Nobody can kick you out of that theater, but nobody will want to watch your movies either. If you yell fire, people cannot stop you, but they can mute your ass.\n\n\n\n\n[Marc](nostr:npub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0) \n\n[878,669](https://mempool.marc26z.com/block/000000000000000000011e78154a4d99f19d0dd2f76655d1e713f5156536e4a1)\n \n[Become Marc's Mention Member](https://marc26z.com/become-a-marcs-mention-member/) \n\n[Marc's Merch](nostr:npub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0)\n\n","sig":"caab416acd826a8209b9559e79548ee294e42aa5a9e340851cd3d08524d96f76aec4cb91cd48c2b32e6ad11b341137f992e9659ead790ee64c070b6b6d8916f7"},"naddr1qq8hyetxd3jkxarfdahz6erkd4esz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzqs9eep0ll6hurjkl3sc2fewgses07mjfwxsdcu3at2m8fd0xrdz3qvzqqqr4gufpptly":{"kind":30023,"id":"89f1c44d46cb63be109426800dee2c0995fcf2c3c8a0864c3874ad8f12feff13","pubkey":"40b9c85fffeafc1cadf8c30a4e5c88660ff6e4971a0dc723d5ab674b5e61b451","created_at":1745508422,"tags":[["d","reflection-dvms"],["title","DVMs and The Reflection Pattern"],["summary","This article explores how the reflection pattern from RPC systems can resolve challenges in the Nostr Data Vending Machine (DVM) ecosystem"],["t","dvm"],["t","nostr"],["t","reflection"],["t","dvms"],["t","dvmcp"],["t","rpc"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/4d04b557e4c6e56c163b95e88feb48c61e78f14060d6d1024a94d607180d9457.png"],["published_at","1745508417"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/gzuuus/reflection-dvms"]],"content":"## Introduction\n\nData Vending Machines (DVMs) have emerged as a crucial component of the Nostr ecosystem, offering specialized computational services to clients across the network. As defined in NIP-90, DVMs operate on an apparently simple principle: \"data in, data out.\" They provide a marketplace for data processing where users request specific jobs (like text translation, content recommendation, or AI text generation)\n\nWhile DVMs have gained significant traction, the current specification faces challenges that hinder widespread adoption and consistent implementation. This article explores some ideas on how we can apply the reflection pattern, a well established approach in RPC systems, to address these challenges and improve the DVM ecosystem's clarity, consistency, and usability.\n\n## The Current State of DVMs: Challenges and Limitations\n\nThe NIP-90 specification provides a broad framework for DVMs, but this flexibility has led to several issues:\n\n### 1. Inconsistent Implementation\n\nAs noted by hzrd149 in \"DVMs were a mistake\" every DVM implementation tends to expect inputs in slightly different formats, even while ostensibly following the same specification. For example, a translation request DVM might expect an event ID in one particular format, while an LLM service could expect a \"prompt\" input that's not even specified in NIP-90.\n\n### 2. Fragmented Specifications\n\nThe DVM specification reserves a range of event kinds (5000-6000), each meant for different types of computational jobs. While creating sub-specifications for each job type is being explored as a possible solution for clarity, in a decentralized and permissionless landscape like Nostr, relying solely on specification enforcement won't be effective for creating a healthy ecosystem. A more comprehensible approach is needed that works with, rather than against, the open nature of the protocol.\n\n### 3. Ambiguous API Interfaces\n\nThere's no standardized way for clients to discover what parameters a specific DVM accepts, which are required versus optional, or what output format to expect. This creates uncertainty and forces developers to rely on documentation outside the protocol itself, if such documentation exists at all.\n\n## The Reflection Pattern: A Solution from RPC Systems\n\nThe reflection pattern in RPC systems offers a compelling solution to many of these challenges. At its core, reflection enables servers to provide metadata about their available services, methods, and data types at runtime, allowing clients to dynamically discover and interact with the server's API.\n\nIn established RPC frameworks like gRPC, reflection serves as a self-describing mechanism where services expose their interface definitions and requirements. In MCP reflection is used to expose the capabilities of the server, such as tools, resources, and prompts. Clients can learn about available capabilities without prior knowledge, and systems can adapt to changes without requiring rebuilds or redeployments. This standardized introspection creates a unified way to query service metadata, making tools like `grpcurl` possible without requiring precompiled stubs.\n\n## How Reflection Could Transform the DVM Specification\n\nBy incorporating reflection principles into the DVM specification, we could create a more coherent and predictable ecosystem. DVMs already implement some sort of reflection through the use of 'nip90params', which allow clients to discover some parameters, constraints, and features of the DVMs, such as whether they accept encryption, nutzaps, etc. However, this approach could be expanded to provide more comprehensive self-description capabilities.\n\n### 1. Defined Lifecycle Phases\n\nSimilar to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), DVMs could benefit from a clear lifecycle consisting of an initialization phase and an operation phase. During initialization, the client and DVM would negotiate capabilities and exchange metadata, with the DVM providing a JSON schema containing its input requirements. nip-89 (or other) announcements can be used to bootstrap the discovery and negotiation process by providing the input schema directly. Then, during the operation phase, the client would interact with the DVM according to the negotiated schema and parameters.\n\n### 2. Schema-Based Interactions\n\nRather than relying on rigid specifications for each job type, DVMs could self-advertise their schemas. This would allow clients to understand which parameters are required versus optional, what type validation should occur for inputs, what output formats to expect, and what payment flows are supported. By internalizing the input schema of the DVMs they wish to consume, clients gain clarity on how to interact effectively.\n\n### 3. Capability Negotiation\n\nCapability negotiation would enable DVMs to advertise their supported features, such as encryption methods, payment options, or specialized functionalities. This would allow clients to adjust their interaction approach based on the specific capabilities of each DVM they encounter.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nWhile building DVMCP, I realized that the RPC reflection pattern used there could be beneficial for constructing DVMs in general. Since DVMs already follow an RPC style for their operation, and reflection is a natural extension of this approach, it could significantly enhance and clarify the DVM specification.\n\nA reflection enhanced DVM protocol could work as follows:\n1. **Discovery**: Clients discover DVMs through existing NIP-89 application handlers, input schemas could also be advertised in nip-89 announcements, making the second step unnecessary.\n2. **Schema Request**: Clients request the DVM's input schema for the specific job type they're interested in\n3. **Validation**: Clients validate their request against the provided schema before submission\n4. **Operation**: The job proceeds through the standard NIP-90 flow, but with clearer expectations on both sides\n\n## Parallels with Other Protocols\n\nThis approach has proven successful in other contexts. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) implements a similar lifecycle with capability negotiation during initialization, allowing any client to communicate with any server as long as they adhere to the base protocol. MCP and DVM protocols share fundamental similarities, both aim to expose and consume computational resources through a JSON-RPC-like interface, albeit with specific differences.\n\ngRPC's reflection service similarly allows clients to discover service definitions at runtime, enabling generic tools to work with any gRPC service without prior knowledge. In the REST API world, OpenAPI/Swagger specifications document interfaces in a way that makes them discoverable and testable.\n\nDVMs would benefit from adopting these patterns while maintaining the decentralized, permissionless nature of Nostr.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI am not attempting to rewrite the DVM specification; rather, explore some ideas that could help the ecosystem improve incrementally, reducing fragmentation and making the ecosystem more comprehensible. By allowing DVMs to self describe their interfaces, we could maintain the flexibility that makes Nostr powerful while providing the structure needed for interoperability.\n\nFor developers building DVM clients or libraries, this approach would simplify consumption by providing clear expectations about inputs and outputs. For DVM operators, it would establish a standard way to communicate their service's requirements without relying on external documentation.\n\nI am currently developing DVMCP following these patterns. Of course, DVMs and MCP servers have different details; MCP includes capabilities such as tools, resources, and prompts on the server side, as well as 'roots' and 'sampling' on the client side, creating a bidirectional way to consume capabilities. In contrast, DVMs typically function similarly to MCP tools, where you call a DVM with an input and receive an output, with each job type representing a different categorization of the work performed.\n\nWithout further ado, I hope this article has provided some insight into the potential benefits of applying the reflection pattern to the DVM specification.","sig":"82f8d211ee018e45375afe3a0f692896e37853466d6903751e39002439d67e8e6695e32c954deab794ef7653fce078aa57dcc0ef0bf34ef66ddf96a80cf0e555"},"naddr1qq8kzursd3jhxatpvdjj6vr5ducsz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzqfngzhsvjggdlgeycm96x4emzjlwf8dyyzdfg4hefp89zpkdgz99qvzqqqr4gu4y65g2":{"kind":30023,"id":"1574a2e9d284bb33d02edc02b7a36214f1895eb8932dee7be73cd62c2abc8470","pubkey":"266815e0c9210dfa324c6cba3573b14bee49da4209a9456f9484e5106cd408a5","created_at":1742382621,"tags":[["d","applesuace-0to1"],["title","Applesauce 0 to 1"],["summary","How to create a nostr app quickly using applesauce"],["alt","Long form article"],["p","3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d"],["t","nostr"],["t","applesauce"],["t","rxjs"],["published_at","1742375669"]],"content":"How to create a nostr app quickly using [applesauce](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/)\n\nIn this guide we are going to build a nostr app that lets users follow and unfollow [fiatjaf](nostr:npub180cvv07tjdrrgpa0j7j7tmnyl2yr6yr7l8j4s3evf6u64th6gkwsyjh6w6)\n\n## 1. Setup new project\n\nStart by setting up a new vite app using `pnpm create vite`, then set the name and select `Solid` and `Typescript`\n\n```sh\n➜  pnpm create vite\n│\n◇  Project name:\n│  followjaf\n│\n◇  Select a framework:\n│  Solid\n│\n◇  Select a variant:\n│  TypeScript\n│\n◇  Scaffolding project in ./followjaf...\n│\n└  Done. Now run:\n\n  cd followjaf\n  pnpm install\n  pnpm run dev\n```\n\n## 2. Adding nostr dependencies\n\nThere are a few useful nostr dependencies we are going to need. `nostr-tools` for the types and small methods, and [`rx-nostr`](https://penpenpng.github.io/rx-nostr/) for making relay connections\n\n```sh\npnpm install nostr-tools rx-nostr\n```\n\n## 3. Setup rx-nostr\n\nNext we need to setup rxNostr so we can make connections to relays. create a new `src/nostr.ts` file with\n\n```ts\nimport { createRxNostr, noopVerifier } from \"rx-nostr\";\n\nexport const rxNostr = createRxNostr({\n  // skip verification here because we are going to verify events at the event store\n  skipVerify: true,\n  verifier: noopVerifier,\n});\n```\n\n## 4. Setup the event store\n\nNow that we have a way to connect to relays, we need a place to store events. We will use the [`EventStore`](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/typedoc/classes/applesauce_core.EventStore.html) class from `applesauce-core` for this. create a new `src/stores.ts` file with\n\n\u003e The event store does not store any events in the browsers local storage or anywhere else. It's in-memory only and provides a model for the UI\n\n```ts\nimport { EventStore } from \"applesauce-core\";\nimport { verifyEvent } from \"nostr-tools\";\n\nexport const eventStore = new EventStore();\n\n// verify the events when they are added to the store\neventStore.verifyEvent = verifyEvent;\n```\n\n## 5. Create the query store\n\nThe event store is where we store all the events, but we need a way for the UI to query them. We can use the [`QueryStore`](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/typedoc/classes/applesauce_core.QueryStore.html) class from `applesauce-core` for this.\n\nCreate a query store in `src/stores.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { QueryStore } from \"applesauce-core\";\n\n// ...\n\n// the query store needs the event store to subscribe to it\nexport const queryStore = new QueryStore(eventStore);\n```\n\n## 6. Setup the profile loader\n\nNext we need a way to fetch user profiles. We are going to use the [`ReplaceableLoader`](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/overview/loaders.html#replaceable-loader) class from [`applesauce-loaders`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/applesauce-loaders) for this.\n\n\u003e `applesauce-loaders` is a package that contains a few loader classes that can be used to fetch different types of data from relays.\n\nFirst install the package\n\n```sh\npnpm install applesauce-loaders\n```\n\nThen create a `src/loaders.ts` file with\n\n```ts\nimport { ReplaceableLoader } from \"applesauce-loaders\";\nimport { rxNostr } from \"./nostr\";\nimport { eventStore } from \"./stores\";\n\nexport const replaceableLoader = new ReplaceableLoader(rxNostr);\n\n// Start the loader and send any events to the event store\nreplaceableLoader.subscribe((packet) =\u003e {\n  eventStore.add(packet.event, packet.from);\n});\n```\n\n## 7. Fetch fiatjaf's profile\n\nNow that we have a way to store events, and a loader to help with fetching them, we should update the `src/App.tsx` component to fetch the profile.\n\nWe can do this by calling the `next` method on the loader and passing a `pubkey`, `kind` and `relays` to it\n\n```tsx\nfunction App() {\n  // ...\n\n  onMount(() =\u003e {\n    // fetch fiatjaf's profile on load\n    replaceableLoader.next({\n      pubkey: \"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d\",\n      kind: 0,\n      relays: [\"wss://pyramid.fiatjaf.com/\"],\n    });\n  });\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n## 8. Display the profile\n\nNow that we have a way to fetch the profile, we need to display it in the UI.\n\nWe can do this by using the [`ProfileQuery`](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/typedoc/functions/applesauce_core.Queries.ProfileQuery.html) which gives us a stream of updates to a pubkey's profile.\n\nCreate the profile using `queryStore.createQuery` and pass in the `ProfileQuery` and the pubkey.\n\n```tsx\nconst fiatjaf = queryStore.createQuery(\n  ProfileQuery,\n  \"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d\"\n);\n```\n\nBut this just gives us an [observable](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable), we need to subscribe to it to get the profile.\n\nLuckily SolidJS profiles a simple [`from`](https://docs.solidjs.com/reference/reactive-utilities/from) method to subscribe to any observable.\n\n\u003e To make things reactive SolidJS uses accessors, so to get the profile we need to call `fiatjaf()`\n\n```tsx\nfunction App() {\n  // ...\n\n  // Subscribe to fiatjaf's profile from the query store\n  const fiatjaf = from(\n    queryStore.createQuery(ProfileQuery, \"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d\")\n  );\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      {/* replace the vite and solid logos with the profile picture */}\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cimg src={fiatjaf()?.picture} class=\"logo\" /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003e{fiatjaf()?.name}\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n      {/* ... */}\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## 9. Letting the user signin\n\nNow we should let the user signin to the app. We can do this by creating a [`AccountManager`](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/accounts/manager.html) class from `applesauce-accounts`\n\nFirst we need to install the packages\n\n```sh\npnpm install applesauce-accounts applesauce-signers\n```\n\nThen create a new `src/accounts.ts` file with\n\n```ts\nimport { AccountManager } from \"applesauce-accounts\";\nimport { registerCommonAccountTypes } from \"applesauce-accounts/accounts\";\n\n// create an account manager instance\nexport const accounts = new AccountManager();\n\n// Adds the common account types to the manager\nregisterCommonAccountTypes(accounts);\n```\n\nNext lets presume the user has a NIP-07 browser extension installed and add a signin button.\n\n```tsx\nfunction App() {\n  const signin = async () =\u003e {\n    // do nothing if the user is already signed in\n    if (accounts.active) return;\n\n    // create a new nip-07 signer and try to get the pubkey\n    const signer = new ExtensionSigner();\n    const pubkey = await signer.getPublicKey();\n\n    // create a new extension account, add it, and make it the active account\n    const account = new ExtensionAccount(pubkey, signer);\n    accounts.addAccount(account);\n    accounts.setActive(account);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      {/* ... */}\n\n      \u003cdiv class=\"card\"\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eAre you following the fiatjaf? the creator of \"The nostr\"\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cbutton onClick={signin}\u003eCheck\u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow when the user clicks the button the app will ask for the users pubkey, then do nothing... but it's a start.\n\n\u003e We are not persisting the accounts, so when the page reloads the user will NOT be signed in. you can learn about persisting the accounts in the [docs](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/accounts/manager.html#persisting-accounts)\n\n## 10. Showing the signed-in state\n\nWe should show some indication to the user that they are signed in. We can do this by modifying the signin button if the user is signed in and giving them a way to sign-out\n\n```tsx\nfunction App() {\n  // subscribe to the currently active account (make sure to use the account$ observable)\n  const account = from(accounts.active$);\n\n  // ...\n\n  const signout = () =\u003e {\n    // do nothing if the user is not signed in\n    if (!accounts.active) return;\n\n    // signout the user\n    const account = accounts.active;\n    accounts.removeAccount(account);\n    accounts.clearActive();\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      {/* ... */}\n\n      \u003cdiv class=\"card\"\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eAre you following the fiatjaf? ( creator of \"The nostr\" )\u003c/p\u003e\n        {account() === undefined ? \u003cbutton onClick={signin}\u003eCheck\u003c/button\u003e : \u003cbutton onClick={signout}\u003eSignout\u003c/button\u003e}\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## 11. Fetching the user's profile\n\nNow that we have a way to sign in and out of the app, we should fetch the user's profile when they sign in.\n\n```tsx\nfunction App() {\n  // ...\n\n  // fetch the user's profile when they sign in\n  createEffect(async () =\u003e {\n    const active = account();\n\n    if (active) {\n      // get the user's relays or fallback to some default relays\n      const usersRelays = await active.getRelays?.();\n      const relays = usersRelays ?

Showing if the user is following fiatjaf\n\nNow that the app is fetching the users profile and contacts we should show if the user is following fiatjaf.\n\n```tsx\nfunction App() {\n  // ...\n\n  // subscribe to the active account, then subscribe to the users contacts or undefined\n  const contacts = from(\n    accounts.active$.pipe(\n      switchMap((account) =\u003e (account ? queryStore.createQuery(UserContactsQuery, account!.pubkey) : of(undefined)))\n    )\n  );\n\n  const isFollowing = createMemo(() =\u003e {\n    return contacts()?.some((c) =\u003e c.pubkey === \"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d\");\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      {/* ... */}\n\n      \u003cdiv class=\"card\"\u003e\n        {/* ... */}\n\n        \u003cSwitch\n          fallback={\n            \u003cp style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\"\u003e\n              Sign in to check if you are a follower of the fiatjaf ( creator of \"The nostr\" )\n            \u003c/p\u003e\n          }\n        \u003e\n          \u003cMatch when={contacts() \u0026\u0026 isFollowing() === undefined}\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003echecking...\u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003c/Match\u003e\n          \u003cMatch when={contacts() \u0026\u0026 isFollowing() === true}\u003e\n            \u003cp style=\"color: green; font-weight: bold; font-size: 2rem;\"\u003e\n              Congratulations!

Adding the follow button\n\nNow that we have a way to check if the user is following fiatjaf, we should add a button to follow him. We can do this with [Actions](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/overview/actions.html) which are pre-built methods to modify nostr events for a user.\n\nFirst we need to install the `applesauce-actions` and `applesauce-factory` package\n\n```sh\npnpm install applesauce-actions applesauce-factory\n```\n\nThen create a `src/actions.ts` file with\n\n```ts\nimport { EventFactory } from \"applesauce-factory\";\nimport { ActionHub } from \"applesauce-actions\";\nimport { eventStore } from \"./stores\";\nimport { accounts } from \"./accounts\";\n\n// The event factory is used to build and modify nostr events\nexport const factory = new EventFactory({\n  // accounts.signer is a NIP-07 signer that signs with the currently active account\n  signer: accounts.signer,\n});\n\n// The action hub is used to run Actions against the event store\nexport const actions = new ActionHub(eventStore, factory);\n```\n\nThen create a `toggleFollow` method that will add or remove fiatjaf from the users contacts.\n\n\u003e We are using the `exec` method to run the action, and the [`forEach`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/Observable#foreach) method from RxJS allows us to await for all the events to be published\n\n```tsx\nfunction App() {\n  // ...\n\n  const toggleFollow = async () =\u003e {\n    // send any created events to rxNostr and the event store\n    const publish = (event: NostrEvent) =\u003e {\n      eventStore.add(event);\n      rxNostr.send(event);\n    };\n\n    if (isFollowing()) {\n      await actions\n        .exec(UnfollowUser, \"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d\")\n        .forEach(publish);\n    } else {\n      await actions\n        .exec(\n          FollowUser,\n          \"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d\",\n          \"wss://pyramid.fiatjaf.com/\"\n        )\n        .forEach(publish);\n    }\n  };\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      {/* ... */}\n\n      \u003cdiv class=\"card\"\u003e\n        {/* ... */}\n\n        {contacts() \u0026\u0026 \u003cbutton onClick={toggleFollow}\u003e{isFollowing() ? \"Unfollow\" : \"Follow\"}\u003c/button\u003e}\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## 14. Adding outbox support\n\nThe app looks like it works now but if the user reloads the page they will still see an the old version of their contacts list. we need to make sure rxNostr is publishing the events to the users outbox relays.\n\nTo do this we can subscribe to the signed in users mailboxes using the query store in `src/nostr.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { MailboxesQuery } from \"applesauce-core/queries\";\nimport { accounts } from \"./accounts\";\nimport { of, switchMap } from \"rxjs\";\nimport { queryStore } from \"./stores\";\n\n// ...\n\n// subscribe to the active account, then subscribe to the users mailboxes and update rxNostr\naccounts.active$\n  .pipe(switchMap((account) =\u003e (account ? queryStore.createQuery(MailboxesQuery, account.pubkey) : of(undefined))))\n  .subscribe((mailboxes) =\u003e {\n    if (mailboxes) rxNostr.setDefaultRelays(mailboxes.outboxes);\n    else rxNostr.setDefaultRelays([]);\n  });\n```\n\nAnd that's it! we have a working nostr app that lets users follow and unfollow fiatjaf.\n","sig":"8d5aea5b366cc827c9ff9736baa237b8207e232ef798fad3e5a1556c0d4fe739af633b02984e5ab90ad53a07e19b971c0854260f42caf25e281b987a95b027d0"},"naddr1qq8x2an0d3mxjmn894j8vmtrwqq3vamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwwpexjmtpdshxuet5qgsxkduqau5h9eeaxu9cfgl9rea2nt35haqjjwxul0vuta3myg2pdjqrqsqqqa28pjjxfm":{"kind":30023,"id":"e02c86f2af77b35113da7a989ff92edaee9fd6cbc873a885961220ce41cf10c8","pubkey":"6b3780ef2972e73d370b84a3e51e7aa9ae34bf412938dcfbd9c5f63b221416c8","created_at":1745582931,"tags":[["d","evolving-dvmcp"],["title","Evolving DVMCP"],["summary","We have been working on a significant update to the DVMCP specification to incorporate the latest Model Context Protocol (MCP) version `2025-03-26`, and it's capabilities."],["t","dvmcp"],["t","mcp"],["t","dvm"],["t","ai"],["t","llm"],["t","nostr"],["t","protocols"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/24f230f0b47ea619e1ba7dfaa2489c7084d73156a978b93776365bab372a35a1.png"],["published_at","1745582927"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzq6ehsrhjjuh885mshp9ru50842dwxjl5z2fcmnaan30k8v3pg9kgqq8x2an0d3mxjmn894j8vmtrwqh8wktg"]],"content":"We have been working on a significant update to the DVMCP specification to incorporate the latest Model Context Protocol (MCP) version `2025-03-26`, and it's capabilities. This draft revision represents our vision for how MCP services can be discovered, accessed, and utilized across the Nostr network while maintaining compatibility between both protocols.\n\n## Expanding Beyond Tools\n\nThe first version of the DVMCP specification focused primarily on tools, functions that could be executed remotely via MCP servers. While this provided valuable functionality, the Model Context Protocol offers more capabilities than just tools. In our proposed update, DVMCP would embrace the complete MCP capabilities framework. Rather than focusing solely on tools, the specification will incorporate resources (files and data sources that can be accessed by clients) and prompts (pre-defined templates for consistent interactions). This expansion transforms DVMCP into a complete framework for service interoperability between protocols.\n\n## Moving Toward a More Modular Architecture\n\nOne of the most significant architectural changes in this draft is our move toward a more modular event structure. Previously, we embedded tools directly within server announcements using NIP-89, creating a monolithic approach that was challenging to extend.\n\nThe updated specification introduces dedicated event kinds for server announcements (31316) and separate event kinds for each capability category. Tools, resources, and prompts would each have their own event kinds (31317, 31318, and 31319 respectively). This separation improves both readability and interoperability between protocols, allowing us to support pagination for example, as described in the MCP protocol. It also enables better filtering options for clients discovering specific capabilities, allows for more efficient updates when only certain capabilities change, and enhances robustness as new capability types can be added with minimal disruption.\n\n## Technical Direction\n\nThe draft specification outlines several technical improvements worth highlighting. We've worked to ensure consistent message structures across all capability types and created a clear separation of concerns between Nostr metadata (in tags) and MCP payloads (in content). The specification includes support for both public server discovery and direct private server connections, comprehensive error handling aligned with both protocols, and detailed protocol flows for all major operations.\n\n## Enhancing Notifications\n\nAnother important improvement in our design is the redesign of the job feedback and notification system. We propose to make event kind 21316 (ephemeral). This approach provides a more efficient way to deliver status updates, progress information, and interactive elements during capability execution without burdening relays with unnecessary storage requirements.\n\nThis change would enable more dynamic interactions between clients and servers, particularly for long-running operations.\n\n## Seeking Community Feedback\n\nWe're now at a stage where community input would be highly appreciated. If you're interested in DVMCP, we'd greatly appreciate your thoughts on our approach. The complete draft specification is available for review, and we welcome your feedback through comments on our pull request at [dvmcp/pull/18](https://github.com/gzuuus/dvmcp/pull/18). Your insights and suggestions will help us refine the specification to better serve the needs of the community.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nAfter gathering and incorporating community feedback, our next step will be updating the various DVMCP packages to implement these changes. This will include reference implementations for both servers (DVMCP-bridge) and clients (DVMCP-discovery).\n\nWe believe this proposed update represents a significant step forward for DVMCP. By embracing the full capabilities framework of MCP, we're expanding what's possible within the protocol while maintaining our commitment to open standards and interoperability.\n\nStay tuned for more updates as we progress through the feedback process and move toward implementation. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the evolution of DVMCP, and we look forward to your continued involvement.","sig":"b2a273ae205f824ee308ab2464537748dac0a7ec8568fa19680b2a26cebd74b2d366b12fccd35b2a7dea92abec3d37f09e4c745be155bef20dd2e93b5aa56ca5"},"naddr1qq8xc6twdvkhyetv94hx7um5wgqs6amnwvaz7tmwdaejumr0dsq3vamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwwpexjmtpdshxuet5qgsp77g933m6yf89hc3xerczfjkd44xhgxz46a0dnug5wwagawrwrjcrqsqqqa28egpvcx":{"kind":30023,"id":"106cf350d78d1c3150cf5754f2f7fa5c9322a2c91d3dc7bca690dc38d60bc822","pubkey":"1f79058c77a224e5be226c8f024cacdad4d741855d75ed9f11473ba8eb86e1cb","created_at":1745479032,"tags":[["title","Linking to Nostr versions of Web content in a machine-readable way"],["summary","A modest proposal for Web publishers and Nostr developers"],["published_at","1745161011"],["t","nostr"],["t","nip-23"],["d","link-rel-nostr"]],"content":"I think we should agree on an HTML element for pointing to the Nostr\nrepresentation of a document/URL on the Web. We could use the existing one for\nlink relations for example:\n\n```html\n\u003clink rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/nostr+json\"\n      href=\"nostr:naddr1qvzqqqr4...\"\n      title=\"This article on Nostr\" /\u003e\n```\n\nThis would be useful in multiple ways:\n\n1. Nostr clients, when fetching meta/preview information for a URL that is\n   linked in a note, can detect that there's a Nostr representation of the\n   content, and then render it in Nostr-native ways (whatever that may be\n   depending on the client)\n2. User agents, usually a browser or browser extension, when opening a URL\n   on the Web, can offer opening the alternative representation of a page in a\n   Nostr client. And/or they could offer to follow the author's pubkey on\n   Nostr. And/or they could offer to zap the content.\n3. When publishing a new article, authors can share their preferred Web URL\n   everywhere, without having to consider if the reader knows about or uses\n   Nostr at all. However, if a Nostr user finds the Web version of an article\n   outside of Nostr, they can now easily jump to the Nostr version of it.\n4. Existing Web publications can retroactively create Nostr versions of their\n   content and easily link the Nostr articles on all of their existing article\n   pages without having to add prominent Nostr links everywhere.\n\nThere are probably more use cases, like Nostr search engines and whatnot. If\nyou can think of something interesting, please tell me.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nIn order to show one way in which this could be used, I have created a small\nWeb Extension called Nostr Links, which will discover alternate Nostr links on\nthe pages you visit.\n\nIf it finds one or more links, it will show a purple Nostr icon in the address\nbar, which you can click to open the list of links.  It's similar to e.g. the\n[Feed Preview](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feed-preview/)\nextension, and also to what the Tor Browser does when it discovers an\n[Onion-Location](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/onion-location/)\nfor the page you're looking at:\n\n![Screenshot](https://gitea.kosmos.org/attachments/178357a0-65e9-40ee-a9e5-55be8eef7d35)\n\nThe links in this popup menu will be `web+nostr:` links, because browsers\ncurrently do not allow web apps or extensions to handle unprefixed `nostr:`\nlinks. (I hope someone is working on getting those on par with `ipfs:` etc.)\n\nFollowing such a link will either open your default Nostr Web app, if you have\nalready configured one, or it will ask you which Web app to open the link with.\n\nCaveat emptor: At the time of writing, my personal default Web app, noStrudel,\n[needs a new release](https://github.com/hzrd149/nostrudel/issues/299) for the\nlinks to find the content.\n\n### Try it now\n\nHave a look at the\n[source code](https://gitea.kosmos.org/raucao/nostr-links)\nand/or\n[download the extension](https://gitea.kosmos.org/raucao/-/packages/generic/nostr-links/)\n(currently only for Firefox).\n\nI have added alternate Nostr links to the Web pages of profiles and long-form\ncontent on the Kosmos relay's domain. It's probably the only place on the Web,\nwhich will trigger the extension right now.\n\nYou can look at [this very\npost](https://nostr.kosmos.org/@raucao/link-rel-nostr) to find an alternate\nlink for example.","sig":"38e92fed4ae0ecbd8ddd25a90b7aad6ad4e3067a908c7505bffe6a1c79fd21e25bbd58d1d6019300e2ac8a0294518ededd6a721a339f9dddad9db51e4887e724"},"naddr1qq8xummnw3ex2efdv9hxgttdv5q3qamnwvaz7tmwdaehgu3wwa5kuegzyr050ptgg7w7y662s0qmm3xm4dsmtnyzux339c4j30yptgf2j50xwqcyqqq823cvm0q9u":{"kind":30023,"id":"f387664020144185adfbb03923ee26c0c8df6128f7282947cdc100b60bb3095d","pubkey":"df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67","created_at":1732074394,"tags":[["d","nostree-and-me"],["title","Nostree And Me"],["summary","I made a pull request for nostree that was merged and I also self-hosted it."],["published_at","1732074001"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzph68s45y080zdd9g8sdacnd6kcd4ejpwrgcju2eghjq45y4f28n8qq8xummnw3ex2efdv9hxgttdv576553m"],["p","df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67"],["published_at","1732074001"],["t","nostree"],["t","github"],["t","nostr"],["t","foss"],["t","my"],["image","https://i.nostr.build/b5miyLLA5I5rvfiV.jpg"],["published_at","1732074001"]],"content":"\n\nNostree.me is a free and open-source version of Linktree built on [nostr](https://nostr.com/).

You can use it to sell stickers at a conference or have a friend pay you back for dinner. It is only limited by your imagination.\n\n### Why Would Anybody Need A ZapShirt?\n\nI no longer \"orange pill\" local businesses. I do not care if they wish to accept bitcoin, but I want to be the change in the world I want to see. I will accept bitcoin on a T-Shirt to show others how easy it is to accept bitcoin as a p2p electronic cash system. Anyone can accept bitcoin as payment if they want to. You could print a sign on a piece of paper if you wanted to. The problem was, nobody I asked wanted a sign, even bitcoiners. So I asked myself...Self, what if you did the opposite? What if the customer accepted bitcoin, but the business owner did not.\n\n\n\nI also thought it would be pretty cool T-Shirt to wear at meet-ups.\n\n### How To Make Your Own Zap Shirt\n1. Create a QR code that sends you to your coinos page, getalby page, strike or whatever you feel comfortable using. This can easily be done at https://libreqr.com/\n2. Use a program like [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) to replace the default QR Code with your own QR code on the file.\n3. Create the shirt.\n\nTo support this please [zap me](nostr:npub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0) or buy one from my store.\n\n#### Can I Buy A Zap Shirt?\nYes. If you would like a shirt, hit me up on nostr\n\nhttps://primal.net/marc\n\n*end README.md*\n\n\nI like the idea of open sourcing my ideas and trying to sell them for sats on the Internet. I am currently working on a site to sell things like this and my gift cards. I feel a little uneasy because I haven't been writing much, but I've been building. The idea is to create bitcoin educational products and services.\nOnward.\n","sig":"ab5d52e270439c6d6ada3348000f70f5079bc6dabd19f52bcba154f63a71fa67f8b422239ff2186ca2dff18d3e1b92746a9917465dda1a079944509d685ee26d"},"naddr1qq9hyetvv9uj6um9w36hqqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qygzxpsj7dqha57pjk5k37gkn6g4nzakewtmqmnwryyhd3jfwlpgxtspsgqqqw4rsrfkzqh":{"kind":30023,"id":"c43472aa47eef91b7ea084c73a6342934c57c5f1f423b5b281a6eb1f70cfd73a","pubkey":"460c25e682fda7832b52d1f22d3d22b3176d972f60dcdc3212ed8c92ef85065c","created_at":1740496839,"tags":[["d","relay-setup"],["title","Relay Setup 101"],["summary","You can either take control of your relay lists, or they will control you.

You either take control of your relay lists, or they will control you. Amethyst offers several lists of relays for our users. We are going to go one by one to help clarify what they are and which options are best for each one. \n\n## Public Home/Outbox Relays \n\nHome relays store all YOUR content: all your posts, likes, replies, lists, etc. It's your home. Amethyst will send your posts here first. Your followers will use these relays to get new posts from you. So, if you don't have anything there, **they will not receive your updates**. \n\nHome relays must allow queries from anyone, ideally without the need to authenticate. They can limit writes to paid users without affecting anyone's experience. \n\nThis list should have a maximum of 3 relays. More than that will only make your followers waste their mobile data getting your posts. Keep it simple. Out of the 3 relays, I recommend: \n- 1 large public, international relay: nos.lol, nostr.mom, relay.damus.io, etc. \n- 1 personal relay to store a copy of all your content in a place no one can delete. Go to [relay.tools](https://relay.tools/) and never be censored again.\n- 1 really fast relay located in your country: paid options like http://nostr.wine are great\n\nDo not include relays that block users from seeing posts in this list. If you do, no one will see your posts.\n\n## Public Inbox Relays \n\nThis relay type receives all replies, comments, likes, and zaps to your posts. If you are not getting notifications or you don't see replies from your friends, it is likely because you don't have the right setup here. If you are getting too much spam in your replies, it's probably because your inbox relays are not protecting you enough. Paid relays can filter inbox spam out. \n\nInbox relays must allow anyone to write into them. It's the opposite of the outbox relay. They can limit who can download the posts to their paid subscribers without affecting anyone's experience.\n\nThis list should have a maximum of 3 relays as well. Again, keep it small. More than that will just make you spend more of your data plan downloading the same notifications from all these different servers. Out of the 3 relays, I recommend: \n- 1 large public, international relay: nos.lol, nostr.mom, relay.damus.io, etc. \n- 1 personal relay to store a copy of your notifications, invites, cashu tokens and zaps.\n- 1 really fast relay located in your country: go to [nostr.watch](https://nostr.watch/relays/find) and find relays in your country\n\nTerrible options include: \n- nostr.wine should not be here. \n- filter.nostr.wine should not be here. \n- inbox.nostr.wine should not be here. \n\n## DM Inbox Relays\n\nThese are the relays used to receive DMs and private content. Others will use these relays to send DMs to you. **If you don't have it setup, you will miss DMs**. DM Inbox relays should accept any message from anyone, but only allow you to download them. \n\nGenerally speaking, you only need 3 for reliability. One of them should be a personal relay to make sure you have a copy of all your messages. The others can be open if you want push notifications or closed if you want full privacy. \n\nGood options are: \n- inbox.nostr.wine and auth.nostr1.com: anyone can send messages and only you can download. Not even our push notification server has access to them to notify you.\n- a personal relay to make sure no one can censor you. Advanced settings on personal relays can also store your DMs privately. Talk to your relay operator for more details.\n- a public relay if you want DM notifications from our servers.\n\nMake sure to add at least one public relay if you want to see DM notifications.\n\n## Private Home Relays\n\nPrivate Relays are for things no one should see, like your drafts, lists, app settings, bookmarks etc. Ideally, these relays are either local or require authentication before posting AND downloading each user\\'s content. There are no dedicated relays for this category yet, so I would use a local relay like Citrine on Android and a personal relay on relay.tools. \n\nKeep in mind that if you choose a local relay only, a client on the desktop might not be able to see the drafts from clients on mobile and vice versa.\n\n## Search relays: \n\nThis is the list of relays to use on Amethyst's search and user tagging with @. **Tagging and searching will not work if there is nothing here.**. This option requires NIP-50 compliance from each relay. Hit the Default button to use all available options on existence today: \n- nostr.wine\n- relay.nostr.band\n- relay.noswhere.com\n\n## Local Relays: \n\nThis is your local storage. Everything will load faster if it comes from this relay. You should install Citrine on Android and write ws://localhost:4869 in this option. \n\n## General Relays: \n\nThis section contains the default relays used to download content from your follows. Notice how you can activate and deactivate the Home, Messages (old-style DMs), Chat (public chats), and Global options in each. \n\nKeep 5-6 large relays on this list and activate them for as many categories (Home, Messages (old-style DMs), Chat, and Global) as possible. \n\nAmethyst will provide additional recommendations to this list from your follows with information on which of your follows might need the additional relay in your list. Add them if you feel like you are missing their posts or if it is just taking too long to load them. \n\n## My setup \n\nHere's what I use: \n1. Go to [relay.tools](https://relay.tools/) and create a relay for yourself. \n2. Go to [nostr.wine](https://nostr.wine/) and pay for their subscription.\n3. Go to [inbox.nostr.wine](https://inbox.nostr.wine/) and pay for their subscription.\n4. Go to [nostr.watch](https://nostr.watch/relays/find) and find a good relay in your country.\n5. Download Citrine to your phone.\n\nThen, on your relay lists, put: \n\nPublic Home/Outbox Relays: \n- nostr.wine\n- nos.lol or an in-country relay. \n- \u003cyour.relay\u003e.nostr1.com\n\nPublic Inbox Relays\n- nos.lol or an in-country relay\n- \u003cyour.relay\u003e.nostr1.com\n\nDM Inbox Relays\n- inbox.nostr.wine\n- \u003cyour.relay\u003e.nostr1.com\n\nPrivate Home Relays\n- ws://localhost:4869 (Citrine)\n- \u003cyour.relay\u003e.nostr1.com (if you want)\n\nSearch Relays\n- nostr.wine\n- relay.nostr.band\n- relay.noswhere.com\n\nLocal Relays\n- ws://localhost:4869 (Citrine)\n\nGeneral Relays\n- nos.lol\n- relay.damus.io\n- relay.primal.net\n- nostr.mom\n\nAnd a few of the recommended relays from Amethyst. \n\n## Final Considerations\n\nRemember, relays can see what your Nostr client is requesting and downloading at all times. They can track what you see and see what you like. They can sell that information to the highest bidder, they can delete your content or content that a sponsor asked them to delete (like a negative review for instance) and they can censor you in any way they see fit. Before using any random free relay out there, make sure you trust its operator and you know its terms of service and privacy policies.","sig":"5a55c474dcb5b1085b3d4288fbc0e7991abc29f2ba02f176386935fc2911db8353df861a87b458f9486477ef0023cf2de73feefdc536f886deb7a9b479722a25"},"naddr1qq9nyvpjxskhyetkd9jhwqgswaehxw309ahx7um5wgh8w6twv5pzqhh8rs9wc5uyvchtkrmxkk6wr68xvspg50slwynnwnh287c9q6hxqvzqqqr4gu3zy009":{"kind":30023,"id":"4a2c66ac9880b7baf6e4dcee875385d0f7c9bccdca24eadbf7602f0bc64435a1","pubkey":"5ee71c0aec5384662ebb0f66b5b4e1e8e664028a3e1f7127374eea3fb0506ae6","created_at":1735261018,"tags":[["d","2024-review"],["title","2025 goals"],["summary","Goodbye 2024, Hello 2025."],["published_at","1735260960"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqhh8rs9wc5uyvchtkrmxkk6wr68xvspg50slwynnwnh287c9q6hxqq9nyvpjxskhyetkd9jhwq65jl0"],["p","5ee71c0aec5384662ebb0f66b5b4e1e8e664028a3e1f7127374eea3fb0506ae6"],["t","nostr"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","lighning"],["published_at","1735260960"]],"content":"Hey, anyone who reads this—thanks for keeping me (somewhat) accountable.\n\nI’m not big on formal New Year’s resolutions, but I do like to review the past year to see where I’ve done well, where I’m lacking, and what new habits I can form in 2025.\n\nWait, isn’t that a resolution? Anyway.\n\nOne thing that’s always been important to me is freedom of speech. I plan to keep using X/Twitter—yes, it has shortcomings, but so does every platform. None will ever be perfect for everyone.\n\nThat said, I believe strongly in decentralization. I’ve been exploring [Nostr](https://nostr.how) for the past two years. Now, I want to use it more often, learn its possibilities, and contribute where I can. I’ve also posted this on [Habla.news](https://habla.news), a Nostr community for long-form content, to encourage myself (and anyone else) to try new platforms and keep an open mind.\n\nThere’s a lot happening with Nostr, Lightning, and other Bitcoin-related projects. It reminds me of the early internet—everyone was contributing, and we had no idea what would stick. I miss those days, and it’s exciting to see a new community forming.\n\nSpeaking of the early internet, I think it’s time I set up a blog or personal site. It’s been ages! Neocities feels retro and has a growing community, so I might start there.\n\nWork will be busy in 2025—2024 was already intense, and the bar is always rising. So I’m not going to overload myself with extra goals. Still, many of my work goals, like earning new certifications, blend into my personal ambitions.\n\nIn 2024, I did well with my health goals. In 2025, I want to build on that, but in small steps. For Q1, I’ll re-establish my Peloton routine; in Q2-Q3, I’ll get back into heavier weight training. I miss lifting and want to push myself again.\n\nI also miss reading—especially sci-fi. It’s high time I make space for that.\n\nSo, this is my short list of goals. I’m sure I’ll refine it as the year unfolds.

While these platforms offer convenience, a more polished user experience, and connectivity, they are ultimately beholden to governments, corporations, and other authorities. This makes them vulnerable to censorship, regulation, and outright bans. In contrast, Nostr represents a shift in how we approach online communication and content sharing. Built on the principles of decentralization and user choice, Nostr cannot be banned, because it is not a platform—it is a protocol.\n\n**PROTOCOLS, NOT PLATFORMS.**\n\nAt the heart of Nostr's philosophy is **user choice**, a feature that fundamentally sets it apart from legacy platforms. In centralized systems, the user experience is dictated by a single person or governing entity. If the platform decides to filter, censor, or ban specific users or content, individuals are left with little action to rectify the situation. They must either accept the changes or abandon the platform entirely, often at the cost of losing their social connections, their data, and their identity.\n\nWhat's happening with TikTok could never happen on Nostr. With Nostr, the dynamics are completely different. Because it is a protocol, not a platform, no single entity controls the ecosystem. Instead, the protocol enables a network of applications and relays that users can freely choose from. If a particular application or relay implements policies that a user disagrees with, such as censorship, filtering, or even government enforced banning, they are not trapped or abandoned. They have the freedom to move to another application or relay with minimal effort.\n\n**THIS IS POWERFUL.**\n\nTake, for example, the case of a relay that decides to censor specific content. On a legacy platform, this would result in frustration and a loss of access for users. On Nostr, however, users can simply connect to a different relay that does not impose such restrictions. Similarly, if an application introduces features or policies that users dislike, they can migrate to a different application that better suits their preferences, all while retaining their identity and social connections.\n\nThe same principles apply to government bans and censorship. A government can ban a specific application or even multiple applications, just as it can block one relay or several relays. China has implemented both tactics, yet Chinese users continue to exist and actively participate on Nostr, demonstrating Nostr's ability to resistant censorship.\n\nHow? Simply, it turns into a game of whack-a-mole. When one relay is censored, another quickly takes its place. When one application is banned, another emerges. Users can also bypass these obstacles by running their own relays and applications directly from their homes or personal devices, eliminating reliance on larger entities or organizations and ensuring continuous access.\n\n**AGAIN, THIS IS POWERUFL.**\n\nNostr's open and decentralized design makes it resistant to the kinds of government intervention that led to TikTok's outages this weekend and potential future ban in the next 90 days. There is no central server to target, no company to regulate, and no single point of failure. (Insert your CEO jokes here). As long as there are individuals running relays and applications, users continue creating notes and sending zaps.\n\nPlatforms like TikTok can be silenced with the stroke of a pen, leaving millions of users disconnected and abandoned. Social communication should not be silenced so incredibly easily. No one should have that much power over social interactions. \n\nWill we on-board a massive wave of TikTokers in the coming hours or days? I don't know.\n\nTikTokers may not be ready for Nostr yet, and honestly, Nostr may not be ready for them either. The ecosystem still lacks the completely polished applications, tools, and services they’re accustomed to. This is where we say \"we're still early\". They may not be early adopters like the current Nostr user base. Until we bridge that gap, they’ll likely move to the next centralized platform, only to face another government ban or round of censorship in the future. But eventually, there will come a tipping point, a moment when they’ve had enough. When that time comes, I hope we’re prepared. If we’re not, we risk missing a tremendous opportunity to onboard people who genuinely need Nostr’s freedom. \n\nUntil then, to all of the Nostr developers out there, keep up the great work and keep building. Your hard work and determination is needed.\n\n### ","sig":"2f3f63d3bea443ae2a9a405fc21d57216391fb6da39076562b005148132c59690e5989f59ce4fb28b1035dee9507a7cd16dc645c0848ee6cd170b51b3722f7bb"},"naddr1qqcrztf395uz63n0w4h8gctfdck4yctyd9hj6ctwvsk5zun5d9ehgt25v94k2mmkv4e8xttsw45hvun9qyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qv5ufyh4lkeslgxxcclg8f0hzazhaw7rsrhvfquxzm2fk64c72hpsxpqqqp65wlr647h":{"kind":30023,"id":"f0de08115c3bf05ff5031016a9c3105c7ab76ad91f0e7e339b20bad1516f44dc","pubkey":"6538925ebfb661f418d8c7d074bee2e8afd778701dd89070c2da936d571e55c3","created_at":1733936957,"tags":[["title","1.1.8 - Fountain Radio and Artist Takeovers"],["summary","Music discovery isn’t what it used to be.

The basic idea was to have a global queue where you pay to play a track - just like the old jukeboxes you can still find in some pubs and bars. You could pay upvote a track to change its position in the queue - and you could send a payment to support the artist currently playing.\n\nThis early iteration of Fountain Radio was far from perfect, but it got us excited about discovering new music again. Today we are excited to launch a new and improved Fountain Radio experience in the [mobile app](https://www.fountain.fm/download) - and give artists the ability to host a takeover. After updating to version 1.1.8, you will be able to tune in to Fountain Radio from the Discover tab.

Adding a track to the costs 100 sats (less than $0.10) and your selection will be added to the end of the queue. You can pay to upvote any track in the queue to change its position. 1 sat equals 1 upvote and the track with the most upvotes will play next. Just like zaps, you can pay as much as you like but the minimum is 100 sats.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74a1040d-faa0-4af8-973f-c2a27a9132d8_1920x1080.png)#### **Support the artist currently playing**\n\nBoost to send a payment with a message on enable streaming to send a small amount for every minute you spend listening. 95% of every boost and streaming payment goes directly to the artist currently playing and the remaining 5% is set aside for fees paid to PodcastIndex and Fountain.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26b8fca7-cf0d-4c94-b1a2-ef3590345d0d_1920x1080.png)#### **Post in the live chat**\n\nHang out with other listeners in the live chat by connecting Nostr. You can post chat messages for free. Every time a track is added or upvoted this appears in the activity feed too.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08e9566d-4af0-435b-8ba8-7bf38b9f962d_1920x1080.png)#### **Save tracks to your library**\n\nListen to your latest discoveries again later in the app. Tap on any content card to add a song to your library or a playlist, or see more music from that artist.\n\n![](blob:https://highlighter.com/eaed77f3-c987-4f4d-b16e-a2d782b19019)#### **Listen to Fountain Radio on other apps**\n\nFountain Radio now has its own RSS feed so you can tune in on any podcast app that supports live streams. Just bear in mind that you will only be able to listen. If you use Nostr livestream platforms such as [zap.stream](https://zap.stream/) or [tunestr.io](https://tunestr.io/), you can listen there and zaps will be paid to the artist currently playing.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd09785aa-2023-4944-9d24-aacf37ff0fa5_1920x1080.png)#### **Artist Takeovers**\n\nArtists can now take control of the music and host a listening party or an AMA. During a takeover, only the host can add tracks to the queue and upvotes are disabled.\n\nFountain Radio takeovers help artists reach new listeners and find new fans, followers and supporters. If you have just posted new music to Fountain after uploading to [Wavlake](https://wavlake.com/) or [RSS Blue](https://rssblue.com/), takeovers are a great way to drive engagement - particularly if it’s the first time you’ve shared music in this way. We will also promote upcoming takeovers to help introduce your music to new audiences.\n\nThe first artist takeover will be the UK’s very own [Joe Martin](https://fountain.fm/artist/cK853uZNytT8FS05vUwC) on **Wednesday 27th November at 12:00pm EST**. If you are interested to take over Fountain Radio and get your music heard by new listeners, get in touch.\n\n#### **Other bug fixes and improvements**\n\n- Fixed grey screen when viewing queue\n\n- Fixed clips not being posted to Nostr\n\n- Fixed custom deposit amount\n\n- Fixed crash after sharing or creating a clip\n\n- Fixed error on The Joe Rogan Experience\n\n- Fixed issue when @ symbol appears in a link sent in a comment\n\n- Fixed issue where latest episodes in library were not updating for some users\n\n- Fixed issue where episode could not be replayed if already listened to\n\n- Added error handling when Nostr keypair is already connected to another account\n\n- Added warning when using Fountain as a guest\n\n- Added prompt to share to Nostr after creating a clip\n\n- Added OPML file explorer","sig":"022dce26d22dca8e70fb08b79e48cbc573ff6ee0452806d103849aa06bd93c2af5ad7ca6bdb4178615bd4e50415228a14b5ba821a7fa0dc18c0e825fc4e2c0ef"},"naddr1qqd5vetpw36hyefd2pshgt2094fx7atjddjj6dnfv9hkkwgpzpmhxue69uhkummnw3ezuamfdejsygrr6kwm3556hc5akuuqh6u39w8kqq3hxv4kextckgyxjnjtu9c0dupsgqqqw4rspymvsv":{"kind":30023,"id":"6f8b148b9da4ecfb3fe907d9394d76e2599789bf91de15fb0308c6934b2e61cb","pubkey":"63d59db8d29abe29db7380beb912b8f600237332b6c9978b208694e4be170f6f","created_at":1732322462,"tags":[["title","Feature: Pat O'Rourke"],["summary","Better Together"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/da609ce1a24b8b31b2bcb82569d5f3f8d7ced5fee46a89d57caeeea55b190a27.jpg"],["t","photography"],["t","noicemag"],["t","street photography"],["t","nostr"],["published_at","1732322462"],["d","Feature-Pat-O-Rourke-6iaok9"]],"content":"This ongoing series \"Better Together\" features surreal settings I have been creating by combining two different photographs that I've shot.

Over the last three years, RHR has become one of the moved shows among Fountain listeners (affectionately known as ‘freaks’). In 2022 they were #3, in 2023 they were #2, and in 2024 they finally claimed the #1 spot. Congratulations, Marty and ODELL. Your dedication and humility is an inspiration to bitcoiners around the world.\n\n### **Show with Most Supporters: [Mr Obnoxious](https://www.fountain.fm/show/LnQlDKTvuF5JwGBaVGv7)**\n\nPeter McCormack announced earlier this year that What Bitcoin Did, the preeminent podcast he has hosted for as long as we can remember, would come to an end to make way for a new show, [Mr Obnoxious](https://www.fountain.fm/show/LnQlDKTvuF5JwGBaVGv7). In December, the Real Bedford FC owner announced that Danny Knowles would be the new custodian - much to the relief of the 800 listeners who supported the show this year. Thanks for everything, Pete!\n\n### **Most Supported Episode: [LINUX Unplugged | 545: 3,062 Days Later](https://www.fountain.fm/episode/E9ya7VOM0I1MyMAV4z81)**\n\nLINUX Unplugged is just one of many popular shows about open-source, security and privacy from Jupiter Broadcasting. Editor-in-chief Chris Fisher finishes the year with three shows in Fountain's top 40. How? He and his co-hosts have made boosting a core part the listener experience, with his audience often sending \"zip code boosts\" (which can get pretty expensive if you live in Alaska).\n\n### **Most Supported Artist: [Ainsley Costello](https://fountain.fm/show/146sKf2f81pgHbqyvCFU)**\n\nAt just 20 years old, Ainsley has been working toward a career in music for over half her life. Her music is the modern pop soundtrack of the next generation. Ainsley first made \"waves\" on the internet in August 2023 as the first artist to receive 1 million sats with her hit song “Cherry On Top.” Since then, she has inspired countless artists to follow her path, becoming the face of this exciting new movement.\n\n### **Artist with Most Supporters: [Man Like Kweks](https://fountain.fm/show/146sKf2f81pgHbqyvCFU)**\n\nDon Kweka is a producer and rapper from Tanzania. When he's not at his desk working his 9 to 5, he's making beats in his bedroom - and he has been prolific in 2024. Earlier this year he told Forbes he had earned a total of $25.68 from United Masters, the distribution company he uses for traditional DSPs (for which he pays a $60 annual fee). Since first publishing his music on Wavlake, he’s earned 2.3 million sats (over $2,000).\n\n### **Most Supported Track: [Abi Muir | Stockholm](https://www.fountain.fm/track/BJQ0sjAFbm6RO6fWFWA3)**\n\nBorn in Scotland and now residing in Australia, Abi’s distinctive, goosebump-inducing vocals and heartfelt lyrics define her creative songwriting. Her unique style sees her delivering memorable, catchy pop songs of singer-songwriter prose with a contemporary pop sound. In Stockholm she explores a darker, harder edge to her music that crosses into alt-rock, topped with Muir's piercing, sultry vocals.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3687aab3-8d88-481f-b8a4-a3ee22de1191_1920x1080.png)### **Read Fountain Rewind 2024 in full on our website**\n\nTo see the full list of award winners, the top 40 shows and artists, plus the top stories from this year, hit the link below.\n\n[Read Fountain Rewind 2024](https://fountain.fm/2024)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F868715cc-a196-4a71-991c-5e49e3024c63_1873x1051.png)### **Share your Rewind for a chance to win Fountain AirPods, limited edition merch and 100,000 sats**\n\nOpen the app to see your Fountain Rewind (make sure you're using the latest version).

One such innovation is Nostr, a lightweight and resilient protocol designed to enable censorship-resistant and decentralized communication. In this article, we will explore what Nostr is, how it works, its advantages, and why it is gaining traction among privacy advocates and decentralized technology enthusiasts.\n\n### **What is Nostr?**\n\nNostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is an open protocol designed for creating censorship-resistant social networks and communication platforms. Unlike traditional social media networks, which rely on centralized servers controlled by corporations, Nostr operates on a decentralized model using cryptographic keys and relays.\n\nNostr allows users to publish and receive messages without the need for a central authority. It is not tied to any single application but instead provides a foundation upon which developers can build various types of social and communication tools.\n\n### **How Does Nostr Work?**\n\nNostr consists of two main components:\n\n1. **Clients** – Applications that users interact with, such as social media platforms, chat applications, or blogging tools.\n2. **Relays** – Servers that distribute messages between clients without storing them permanently or acting as gatekeepers.\n\nWhen a user wants to send a message or publish content, their client signs the data using their private key and broadcasts it to multiple relays. Other users who subscribe to those relays can receive and interact with the messages.\n\nNostr does not have a concept of user accounts managed by a central entity. Instead, identity is established using public and private cryptographic keys. The private key is used to sign messages, while the public key acts as the user’s identity across the network.\n\n### **Advantages of Nostr**\n\n1. **Censorship Resistance** – Since Nostr does not rely on a central authority, it is much harder for governments or corporations to censor content. Users can publish messages freely, and if one relay refuses to distribute them, they can simply use another.\n\n2. **Privacy and Security** – Messages are signed using cryptographic keys, ensuring authenticity and reducing the risk of impersonation. Users retain full control over their identities and content.\n\n3. **Interoperability** – Nostr is not tied to a single platform or application. Developers can create different types of services using the protocol, from microblogging platforms to encrypted messaging apps.\n\n4. **Resilience** – Since the network relies on multiple relays instead of a single centralized server, it is less susceptible to shutdowns or attacks.\n\n### **Use Cases for Nostr**\n\n- **Decentralized Social Media** – Platforms like Twitter alternatives can be built on Nostr, allowing users to post updates without fear of censorship.\n- **Private Messaging** – Secure and encrypted messaging applications can be developed using the protocol.\n- **Blogging and Content Publishing** – Writers and journalists can publish articles in a censorship-resistant manner.\n- **Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Communities** – Many Bitcoin enthusiasts are adopting Nostr due to its decentralized nature and alignment with privacy-focused principles.\n\n### **Challenges and Limitations**\n\nWhile Nostr is a promising technology, it is still in its early stages and faces several challenges:\n\n- **Adoption and Network Effects** – Since Nostr is not as widely used as traditional social media platforms, building a strong user base is a challenge.\n- **Spam and Moderation** – Without central moderation, handling spam and malicious content is more difficult, requiring innovative solutions such as reputation-based filtering.\n- **User Experience** – Decentralized networks often have a steeper learning curve for new users compared to centralized platforms.\n\n### **The Future of Nostr**\n\nDespite these challenges, Nostr is gaining momentum among privacy advocates, developers, and decentralized technology supporters. With continued development and improvements in usability, Nostr has the potential to reshape online communication by offering a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant platform.\n\nAs more developers create applications and services using Nostr, its ecosystem is likely to expand, providing a viable alternative to traditional social media networks. Whether you are a developer, a privacy-conscious user, or someone interested in the future of decentralized internet, Nostr is a technology worth exploring.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nNostr represents a significant step toward a more open and decentralized internet. By removing central points of control and enabling user-driven communication, it empowers individuals to interact freely without the risk of censorship or data exploitation. As the protocol matures and more applications emerge, it could play a crucial role in shaping the next generation of online communication.\n\nIf you are interested in experimenting with Nostr, you can start by exploring various Nostr-based applications, setting up your cryptographic keys, and connecting with the growing community of users and developers. The future of decentralized communication is just beginning, and Nostr is at the forefront of this movement.\n\n**Understanding Nostr: A Decentralized Social Network Protocol**\n\nIn an era where centralized platforms dominate the internet, concerns over censorship, privacy, and data ownership have led to the rise of decentralized alternatives.

Each package has been updated to 1.0.0, marking a stable API for developers to build upon.\n\n## Applesauce core changes\n\nThere was a change in the `applesauce-core` package in the `QueryStore`.\n\nThe [`Query`](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/typedoc/types/applesauce_core.Query.html) interface has been converted to a method instead of an object with `key` and `run` fields.\n\nA bunch of new helper methods and queries were added, checkout the [changelog](https://github.com/hzrd149/applesauce/blob/master/packages/core/CHANGELOG.md#100) for a full list.\n\n## Applesauce Relay\n\nThere is a new `applesauce-relay` package that provides a simple [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/api/webSocket/webSocket) based api for connecting to relays and publishing events.\n\nDocumentation: [applesauce-relay](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/overview/relays.html)\n\n**Features:**\n\n- A simple API for subscribing or publishing to a single relay or a group of relays\n- No `connect` or `close` methods, connections are managed automatically by rxjs\n- NIP-11 ``auth_required`` support\n- Support for NIP-42 authentication\n- Prebuilt or custom re-connection back-off\n- Keep-alive timeout (default 30s)\n- Client-side Negentropy sync support\n\n**Example Usage: Single relay**\n\n```typescript\nimport { Relay } from \"applesauce-relay\";\n\n// Connect to a relay\nconst relay = new Relay(\"wss://relay.example.com\");\n\n// Create a REQ and subscribe to it\nrelay\n  .req({\n    kinds: [1],\n    limit: 10,\n  })\n  .subscribe((response) =\u003e {\n    if (response === \"EOSE\") {\n      console.log(\"End of stored events\");\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"Received event:\", response);\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n**Example Usage: Relay pool**\n\n```typescript\nimport { Relay, RelayPool } from \"applesauce-relay\";\n\n// Create a pool with a custom relay\nconst pool = new RelayPool();\n\n// Create a REQ and subscribe to it\npool\n  .req([\"wss://relay.damus.io\", \"wss://relay.snort.social\"], {\n    kinds: [1],\n    limit: 10,\n  })\n  .subscribe((response) =\u003e {\n    if (response === \"EOSE\") {\n      console.log(\"End of stored events on all relays\");\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"Received event:\", response);\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n## Applesauce actions\n\nAnother new package is the `applesauce-actions` package. This package provides a set of async operations for common Nostr actions.\n\nActions are run against the events in the `EventStore` and use the `EventFactory` to create new events to publish.\n\nDocumentation: [applesauce-actions](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/overview/actions.html)\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { ActionHub } from \"applesauce-actions\";\n\n// An EventStore and EventFactory are required to use the ActionHub\nimport { eventStore } from \"./stores.ts\";\nimport { eventFactory } from \"./factories.ts\";\n\n// Custom publish logic\nconst publish = async (event: NostrEvent) =\u003e {\n  console.log(\"Publishing\", event);\n  await app.relayPool.publish(event, app.defaultRelays);\n};\n\n// The `publish` method is optional for the async `run` method to work\nconst hub = new ActionHub(eventStore, eventFactory, publish);\n```\n\nOnce an `ActionsHub` is created, you can use the `run` or `exec` methods to execute actions:\n\n```typescript\nimport { FollowUser, MuteUser } from \"applesauce-actions/actions\";\n\n// Follow fiatjaf\nawait hub.run(\n  FollowUser,\n  \"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d\",\n);\n\n// Or use the `exec` method with a custom publish method\nawait hub\n  .exec(\n    MuteUser,\n    \"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d\",\n  )\n  .forEach((event) =\u003e {\n    // NOTE: Don't publish this event because we never want to mute fiatjaf\n    // pool.publish(['wss://pyramid.fiatjaf.com/'], event)\n  });\n```\n\nThere are a log more actions including some for working with NIP-51 lists (private and public), you can find them in the [reference](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/typedoc/modules/applesauce-actions.Actions.html)\n\n## Applesauce loaders\n\nThe `applesauce-loaders` package has been updated to support any relay connection libraries and not just `rx-nostr`.\n\n**Before:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { ReplaceableLoader } from \"applesauce-loaders\";\nimport { createRxNostr } from \"rx-nostr\";\n\n// Create a new rx-nostr instance\nconst rxNostr = createRxNostr();\n\n// Create a new replaceable loader\nconst replaceableLoader = new ReplaceableLoader(rxNostr);\n```\n\n**After:**\n\n```typescript\n\nimport { Observable } from \"rxjs\";\nimport { ReplaceableLoader, NostrRequest } from \"applesauce-loaders\";\nimport { SimplePool } from \"nostr-tools\";\n\n// Create a new nostr-tools pool\nconst pool = new SimplePool();\n\n// Create a method that subscribes using nostr-tools and returns an observable\nfunction nostrRequest: NostrRequest = (relays, filters, id) =\u003e {\n  return new Observable((subscriber) =\u003e {\n    const sub = pool.subscribe(relays, filters, {\n      onevent: (event) =\u003e {\n        subscriber.next(event);\n      },\n      onclose: () =\u003e subscriber.complete(),\n      oneose: () =\u003e subscriber.complete(),\n    });\n\n    return () =\u003e sub.close();\n  });\n};\n\n// Create a new replaceable loader\nconst replaceableLoader = new ReplaceableLoader(nostrRequest);\n```\n\nOf course you can still use rx-nostr if you want:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createRxNostr } from \"rx-nostr\";\n\n// Create a new rx-nostr instance\nconst rxNostr = createRxNostr();\n\n// Create a method that subscribes using rx-nostr and returns an observable\nfunction nostrRequest(\n  relays: string[],\n  filters: Filter[],\n  id?: string,\n): Observable\u003cNostrEvent\u003e {\n  // Create a new oneshot request so it will complete when EOSE is received\n  const req = createRxOneshotReq({ filters, rxReqId: id });\n  return rxNostr\n    .use(req, { on: { relays } })\n    .pipe(map((packet) =\u003e packet.event));\n}\n\n// Create a new replaceable loader\nconst replaceableLoader = new ReplaceableLoader(nostrRequest);\n```\n\nThere where a few more changes, check out the [changelog](https://github.com/hzrd149/applesauce/blob/master/packages/loaders/CHANGELOG.md#100)\n\n## Applesauce wallet\n\nIts far from complete, but there is a new `applesauce-wallet` package that provides a actions and queries for working with [NIP-60](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/60.md) wallets.\n\nDocumentation: [applesauce-wallet](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/wallet/getting-started.html)\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { CreateWallet, UnlockWallet } from \"applesauce-wallet/actions\";\n\n// Create a new NIP-60 wallet\nawait hub.run(CreateWallet, [\"wss://mint.example.com\"], privateKey);\n\n// Unlock wallet and associated tokens/history\nawait hub.run(UnlockWallet, { tokens: true, history: true });\n```","sig":"17ef577a05e99d219e77f1201b4c3685d190152ad56b3c470d433e47e2e82e4f4cff75019e2c29bd30b5956b15cd314ebbdc8f7fad8801e9c6af8c9ac354ba66"},"naddr1qqdxummnw3e82er9dskhvvpwxsejuvpdx5hnytejxqer2qgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qygpxdq27pjfppharynrvhg6h8v2taeya5ssf49zkl9yyu5gxe4qg55psgqqqw4rspnvc6x":{"kind":30023,"id":"62411284e62d723ead7b49bb56dd75558b5b54f61d4ab8569cfca30b0c46f69a","pubkey":"266815e0c9210dfa324c6cba3573b14bee49da4209a9456f9484e5106cd408a5","created_at":1746224699,"tags":[["d","nostrudel-v0.43.0-5/2/2025"],["title","noStrudel

packages but the app is stable enough for another release.\n\nThis update is pretty much a full rewrite of the non-visible parts of the app. all the background services were either moved out to the applesauce packages or rewritten, the result is that noStrudel is a little faster and much more consistent with connections and publishing.\n## New layout\nThe app has a new layout now, it takes advantage of the full desktop screen and looks a little better than it did before.\n![](https://cdn.hzrd149.com/c8ba0b9fb9c381c97c508aa070fd35af506bbdb3317da0c487fa689ab42dcb9f)\n## Removed NIP-72 communities\nThe NIP-72 communities are no longer part of the app, if you want to continue using them there are still a few apps that support them ( like [satellite.earth](https://satellite.earth/) ) but noStrudel won't support them going forward.\n\nThe communities where interesting but ultimately proved too have some fundamental flaws, most notably that all posts had to be approved by a moderator. There were some good ideas on how to improve it but they would have only been patches and wouldn't have fixed the underlying issues.\n\nI wont promise to build it into noStrudel, but NIP-29 (relay based groups) look a lot more promising and already have better moderation abilities then NIP-72 communities could ever have.\n\n## Settings view\nThere is now a dedicated settings view, so no more hunting around for where the relays are set or trying to find how to add another account. its all in one place now\n![](https://cdn.hzrd149.com/026b2a9c90a2235cabbae483eec57058cf560957ab0ab396845a853e84e0022b)\n\n## Cleaned up lists\nThe list views are a little cleaner now, and they have a simple edit modal\n![](https://cdn.hzrd149.com/b87ea507b51c705224f6f3f12335517954abec83a8ada108b9aa77233b9db2fa.webp)\n![](https://cdn.hzrd149.com/6ee5132dc131e50c3626bd8909928f6f457fc4e45ff96208d1977b7bb7703bf1)\n\n## New emoji picker\nJust another small improvement that makes the app feel more complete.\n![](https://cdn.hzrd149.com/2c4eae0a2c85958195a02c161c8cce8ba8cf522eedeba9c1b954bdde942d1e6a)\n\n## Experimental Wallet\nThere is a new \"wallet\" view in the app that lets you manage your NIP-60 cashu wallet. its very experimental and probably won't work for you, but its there and I hope to finish it up so the app can support NIP-61 nutzaps.\n\n**WARNING: Don't feed the wallet your hard earned sats, it will eat them!**\n![](https://cdn.hzrd149.com/0c1f18788546d3044b9f012f52d44b55a01a895ba5c40744ad3d4eef7b8b42de)\n\n## Smaller improvements\n- Added NSFW flag for replies\n- Updated NIP-48 bunker login to work with new spec\n- Linkfy BIPs\n- Added 404 page\n- Add NIP-22 comments under badges, files, and articles\n- Add max height to timeline notes\n- Fix articles view freezing on load\n- Add option to mirror blobs when sharing notes\n- Remove \"open in drawer\" for notes","sig":"647c9686329eb4737fb90e091527d5716c1ace7fe14b46c5b7500d581b856dacc80fa209ad7dd2f055830a4abc6c4531dfe970bb05fc6b725f0bbf94b4e5f97a"},"naddr1qqehxmmkv4ex26t8de68jtt5dpex7at8dqsx6ct5dpjk6ct5d93hxgrrdpshqar9wgsrvw3qwd3kzunrd968jqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qyg9ljhs6gk74a3w2p4pq7n64e5qkghrcf86hlhgnhrz6lmzwhhxgfqpsgqqqw4rssrkdk3":{"kind":30023,"id":"1dfb2e86b6318afb8fc0315f49f176c3de5f601586ef68a27d8c81a0b77080d8","pubkey":"bf95e1a45bd5ec5ca0d420f4f55cd01645c7849f57fdd13b8c5afec4ebdcc848","created_at":1745565001,"tags":[["title","Sovereignty Through Mathematics Chapter 6: Scarcity"],["summary","Bitcoin Infinity Academy - Course 1 Part 7"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/5f025e6941b046cd7fa43876f5cc2573ac6736648d7568c8f6f270450629e7a8.png"],["published_at","1745565001"],["d","sovereignty-through mathematics chapter 6: scarcity"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","nostr"],["t","philosophy"],["t","books"],["r","wss://feeds.nostr.band/audio"],["r","wss://filter.nostr.wine/"],["r","wss://nostr.wine/"],["r","wss://nrelay.c-stellar.net/"],["r","wss://purplepag.es/"],["r","wss://relay.nostr.band/"],["r","wss://relay.primal.net/"],["r","wss://nostr-relay.algotech.io/"],["r","wss://nostr-relay.bitcoin.ninja/"]],"content":"This is a part of the Bitcoin Infinity Academy course on Knut Svanholm's book Bitcoin: Sovereignty Through Mathematics. For more information, check out our[ Geyser page](https://geyser.fund/project/infinity)!\n\n## Scarcity\n\nWhat makes a commodity scarce? What is scarcity in the first place? What other properties can be deducted from an object’s scarcity? How are scarcity, energy, time, and value connected? Scarcity might seem easy to describe on the surface, but in reality, it’s not. Not when you take infinity into account. Infinity is a concept that has puzzled the human mind for as long as it has been able to imagine it. If it ever has. It is a very abstract concept, and it’s always linked to time simply because even imagining an infinite number would take an infinite amount of time. If we truly live in an infinite universe, scarcity cannot exist. If something exists in an infinite universe, an infinite number of copies of this something must also exist since the probability of this being true would also be infinite in an infinite universe. Therefore, scarcity must always be defined within a set framework. No frame, no scarcity.\n\nThink of it this way: the most expensive artwork ever sold at the time of writing was the *Salvator Mundi*, painted by Leonardo da Vinci. It’s not even a particularly beautiful painting, so why the high price? Because Da Vinci originals are scarce. A poster of the painting isn’t expensive at all, but the original will cost you at least 450 million US Dollars. All because we agree to frame its scarcity around the notion that it is a Da Vinci original, of which under twenty exist today. Historically, scarcity has always been framed around real-world limits to the supply of a good. Most of the great thinkers of the Austrian school of economics from the twentieth century believed that the value of a monetary good arises from its scarcity and that scarcity is always connected to the real-world availability of that good. Most of them believed that a gold standard would be the hardest form of money that we would ever see and the closest thing to an absolutely scarce resource as we would ever know.\n\nIn the late 90’s, the cryptographers that laid the groundwork for what would become Bitcoin reimagined scarcity as anything with an unforgeable costliness. This mindset is key to understanding the connection between scarcity and value. Anything can be viewed as scarce if it’s sufficiently hard to produce and hard to fake the production cost of — in other words, easy to verify the validity of. The zeros at the beginning of a hashed Bitcoin block are the Proof of Work that proves that the created coins in that block were costly to produce. People who promote the idea that the mining algorithm used to produce Bitcoin could be more environmentally friendly or streamlined are either deliberately lying or missing the point. The energy expenditure is the very thing that gives the token its value because it provides proof to the network that enough computing power was sacrificed in order to keep the network sufficiently decentralized and thus resistant to change. \"Easy to verify\" is the flipside of the \"unforgeable costliness\" coin. The validity of a Bitcoin block is very easy to verify since all you need to do is look at its hash, make sure the block is part of the strongest chain, and that it conforms to all consensus rules. In order to check whether a gold bar is real or not, you probably need to trust a third party. Fiat money often comes with a plethora of water stamps, holograms, and metal stripes, so in a sense, they’re hard to forge. What you cannot know about a fiat currency at any given moment, though, is how much of it is in circulation. What you do know about fiat currencies is that they’re not scarce.\n\nBitcoin provides us with absolute scarcity for the first time in human history. It is a remarkable breakthrough. Even though you can’t make jewelry or anything else out of Bitcoin, its total supply is fixed. After the year 2140, after the last Bitcoin has been mined, the total amount of Bitcoin in circulation can only go down. This limited supply is what the gold standards of the past were there for in the first place. Bitcoin’s supply is much more limited than that of gold, however, since they will be lost as time goes by. Since the supply is so limited, it doesn’t matter what the current demand is. The potential upside to its value is literally limitless due to this relationship between supply and demand. The “backing” that other currencies have is only there to assume people that the currency will keep its value over time, and the only way of ensuring this is to limit the supply. Bitcoin does this better than any other thing before it. Leonardo da Vinci’s original paintings are extremely valuable because of Leonardo’s brand name and the fact that there are only about 13 of them left. One day there’ll be less than one left. The same is true for Bitcoin.\n\nScarcity on the Internet was long believed to be an impossible invention, and it took a multi-talented genius such as Satoshi Nakamoto to figure out all the different parts that make Bitcoin so much more than the sum of them. His disappearance from the project was one such part, maybe the most important one. The thing about computerized scarcity is that it was a one-time invention. Once it was invented, the invention could not be recreated. That’s just the nature of data. Computers are designed to be able to replicate any data set any number of times. This is true for every piece of code there is, and digital scarcity needed to be framed somehow to work. Bitcoin’s consensus rules provided such a frame. Bitcoin certainly *seems* to provide true digital scarcity, and if the game theoretical theories that it builds on are correct, its promise of an ever-increasing value will be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nIn 2018, the inflation rate of the Venezuelan Bolivar was a staggering 80,000%. Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro, effectively killed the Venezuelan economy with socialism. It has happened before — and sadly, it is likely to happen again. The main problem with socialism is not that people aren’t incentivized to work in socialist countries. On the contrary, hungry people under the threat of violence tend to work harder than most. The problem with state-owned production is that there is no free market price mechanism to reflect the true demand for goods and, therefore, no way of knowing how much supply the state should produce. Everything is in constant surplus or shortage — often the latter, as the empty supermarket shelves in Venezuela depressingly attest. Chavez and Maduro attempted to rescue the country’s economy by printing more money — which simply does not work. Their true motives for printing money are, of course, questionable given that it depreciated the value of Bolivar bills to less than that of toilet paper. As mentioned in earlier chapters, inflation is the greatest hidden threat to themselves that humans have ever created.\n\nA few hundred years ago, the Catholic Church held the lion’s share of political power throughout Europe. Today, power primarily resides with nation-states in collusion with multinational corporations. The separation of church and state triggered the migration of power from the former to the latter, emancipating many citizens in the process. Still, places like Venezuela are sad proof that “the people” are still not in power in many self-proclaimed democracies — if in any, for that matter. Another separation will have to take place first: The separation of money and state. We, the people of Planet Earth, now have the means at our disposal for this separation to take place. Whether we use them or not will determine how emancipated and independent our children can and will be in the future.\n\n### **About the Bitcoin Infinity Academy**\n\nThe Bitcoin Infinity Academy is an educational project built around [Knut Svanholm](http://primal.net/knut)’s books about Bitcoin and Austrian Economics.

Really testing my patience, but at least i saw a bit of progress. TollGate's had a nice wrap-up for the Proof Of Concept app, which some great new ideas on how to make the user experience even better! Let's dive in!**\n\n## GitHub Actions\nI've been having a low-key fight with the github actions runner containers. I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out WHY the blossom upload action would just not work. I was quick to find out that the action is being ran with an older version of NodeJS (v18) while the blossom uploader requires v20. Not a big deal you'd say as i just set the version to 20 in the pipeline. However, doing that explicitly had zero impact, and after diving down the github runner rabbit hole i concluded that the Actions that are imported (from marketplace) will just run with whatever node version is already installed in the runner's docker image. Which in the case of the act runner is Node 18. I tried updating to the latest images but I haven't been able to find a compatible one yet...\n\n### Payments\nI've been working on getting the money aspect working in the ci-cd runner. I added a wallet and a scheduled payout. I took this from the nostr-epoxy project and did some updates to upgrade to cashu-ts v2.\n\nI added some advertisement info like the specs of the machine that the runner is on. I've been pondering how the payment flow should work though.\nSee the problem is that because of the nature of this DVM, it cannot predict how long a job will take to execute, a customer can literally do anything in their pipeline that will make a job last forever. I think for that reason there has to be some kind of deposit/credit or stream besides the one-off payment. I made a post asking what the best way would be: nostr:note17apw8unznvwx2k3z48t7qz6cq26tk077w83qh3f7zxukfrrfukhs7mpcsn\n\nI currently feel best about the option of just sending a bunch of ecash that will sure be enough to execute the job (and otherwise act as the time-out) and that if the DVM uses less of that money, it will send it back as pubkey locked cashu tokens, to a given npub. Maybe NIP-60 can be a great way to handle returning the 'change' to the user.\n\nSome ideas i have now:\n- Billing should be per second\n- Advertising should:\n\t- advertise as sats/minute\n\t- include specs of the machine, ideally searchable by tag\n\n### Job request\nSo the flow i'm thinking of is:\n\n- User posts request\n\t- repository\n\t- branch\n\t- yaml path\n\t- bid (max price per minute)\n\t- min_vcpu\n\t- min_ram\n\t- min_storage\n\n- DVM responds with\n\t- price per minute\n\t- vcpu\n\t- ram\n\t- storage\n\t- runner-types\n\t- price per minute\n\n- User posts request:\n\t- ... [same as above]\n\t- cashu payment\n\t- cashu return pubkey + relay\n\n### User Interface\nI also worked on building out a very basic user interface to run the GitHub Actions dvm.\n\n![ui2](https://cdn.satellite.earth/0f91f3b9d71cd409448e86c3fd9cabe43eb7dbfd2d8265c5e3349625ef18cf53.png)\nThe UI then shows all feedback to the job, where the first feedback event you can see gives back a status processing, and the next one gives back the console output of the pipeline run.\n\nnostr:npub15qydau2hjma6ngxkl2cyar74wzyjshvl65za5k5rl69264ar2exs5cyejr and I agreed he'll copy over this basic setup into his upcoming version of gitWorkshop.dev which I can then build upon so we can experiment with the User Experience (how to handle competing Runners, display results, payments, etc...)\n![ui](https://cdn.satellite.earth/361f690c87ea5b0402abec3a21b55d990479f7f974f0eafb9b8224c6809b3e92.png)\n\n## Tollgate\nThere's also been the issue that has been bothering me since last week: Being able to dismiss a captive portal programatically in the Android app.\n\nDuring a weekly check-in that nostr:npub1k03rader0vm94j5ee8fg7pc2x9xkr2phu77sljas7qu5mh8mvgvqpe8rty and I set up we discussed the issue. To me, it's a problem having the user to jump through all these hoops to connect, which should be as much automated as possible.\n\nWe discussed what if we'd ditch the open network and go with a WPA2 (password) protected one and have no captive portal. But then we lose the ability to do onboarding / expose users to Tollgate through the captive portal. Then the idea came up to create an extra (hidden) network for the app to use, while keeping the open one with the captive portal. I did not know it was possible to create multiple networks on the same (physical) radio, but apparently it's quite common. You lose a bit on efficiency but it shouldn't be too bad. The only challenge would be to exempt this network from getting a captive portal while still using the OpenNDS software to manage user's sessions. We'll see but this gives me a lot of hope for a seamless user experience!\n\nAfter this call, despite our possible new direction I did want to try and get the full app flow working, to validate if it's possible at all. And after some digging int the Tauri docs and even their discord community i finally found what the issue was with me not receiving the android event for the captive portal. I'd ben adding the listener for this event to the `androidmanifest.xml` file for the Tauri Android plugin, while I had to put it into the tauri app one's itself -one level higher- if you will...\n\nAnyway, that worked and I was FINALLY able to create the following full flow!

First, I worked on getting back on some comments on my proposals on [NIP-42](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1609) and the [Transport Method Announcement NIP](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1585).\n\n### NIP-42 proposal\nThe responses to the proposal of the NIP-42 exstension confused me a bit, my interpretation of nip42 AUTH was both authentication and authoriziation. But as it turns out people only want authentication to be part of this NIP, which is understandable. I'm wondering what other structure should be used for authorization then. I thought this would be a great place because of the similar allow/disallow mechanism that applies to both authentication and authorization.\n\nI get the argument that authorization would need to be handled somewhere else. In my case i want authorization by payment. meaning there is no Authentication, we don't care who it is.\n\nI worked out this comment, to see what other options would come up. https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1609#issuecomment-2577243988\n\n### Evaluating current state Epoxy\nIt's been a little bit since I made any progress on epoxy, but this week i'm picking it back up. So i'm trying to see what my next steps on it will be. I thought first maybe i need to add the random delays, but that's in the bigger scheme of things a 'nice to have'. I should probably first work on fixing the nightmare that is unencrypted traffic. And for that, i need pubkey addressing to work properly.\n\n### Evaluating current state CI/CD\nThis week i met up with Auggie, who's quite knowledgable into CI/CD stuff. I think a cool short-term goal for myself is to get an automated build and publish of the epoxy docker container. That shouldn't be too hard to attain, but I needed to refresh my memory on what I last worked on for a bit.\n\nI realized that that was a very hacky approach and i really want to know Auggie's perspective on it. I came across his comment on my [blogpost about it](https://habla.news/u/arjen@swissdash.site/chaining-dvms-for-nostr-cicd-pipelines) which i'd missed earlier. My doubt is wether i should try to rebuild what CI/CD is from scratch, but nostr-native. Or should I strive to have something backwards-compatible and use existing GitHub/Gitea runners?\n\nIn our call we settled on trying to get the runner approach working and see how we go from there. I'd work out a GitHub action so we could upload artifacts to Blossom and he'd look into the inner workings of Gittea as he had worked on the stack before.\n\n## Blossom uploads GitHub action\nI tried to move forward on the Blossom uploads on friday but got stuck on imports that would just not resolve on the github action (`ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`). Long story short, I was just not bundling my build properly and (spoiler) worked this out on Monday.\n\n## In short\nQuite an alright week, ramping up my efforts now and i'm exited for what's coming. See you next week!","sig":"d77c69a5b55f3122de136c1f3f7b4c63017d0f58bde40f48c6021197c2499ac0099756d68f5f84b2467f9700b9eaf625925c768bc16e19ff6c661a2383be39c4"},"naddr1qqfk67fdwajk26edxskkjm3dwfjhv6t9wuq3qamnwvaz7tmwdaehgu3wwa5kuegzyzamthdqu92k09ulq4p5q77uyqeadu9mkv8hy5f2nqw0mvhsncn5wqcyqqq823cf5mr6k":{"kind":30023,"id":"a724048e95493ad5845c5bfe0c001d7be8658549a84a267139a38c336acc1431","pubkey":"bbb5dda0e15567979f0543407bdc2033d6f0bbb30f72512a981cfdb2f09e2747","created_at":1737948130,"tags":[["d","my-week-4-in-review"],["title","My week (4) in review"],["summary","I've been on a a bit of a TollGate tangent this week, with some incredible progress!"],["t","nostr"],["t","ci-cd"],["t","tollgate"],["image","https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/clock-face-glowing-midnight-time-up-generative-ai_188544-9607.jpg"],["published_at","1737824400"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzpwa4mkswz4t8j70s2s6q00wzqv7k7zamxrmj2y4fs88aktcfuf68qqfk67fdwajk26edxskkjm3dwfjhv6t9wupv4qtu"]],"content":"At Nostriga in the middle of last year I got introduced to TollGate, a project to resell internet access, I was fascinated and hyped for this to become a thing. Later during SEC-03 I got involved in the development of TollGate and helped work out the idea utilizing Nostr to make the experience of using a TollGate super smooth. That's where the idea started to make a cross-platform app that would autoconnect and start streaming sats to TollGates for internet access. \n\nI'd been working on it here and there and this week I feel like I got in to the developer high (i'm sure some of you know what that feels like) and I just wanted to see the android app work! So as the week moved along I just kept being drawn in. And progress there was! The vision we had during SEC is coming to be a reality very fast.\n\n**TL;DR** There's a demo video at the bottom.\n\n## Quick CI/CD update\nI've been talking to DanConwayDev to work together on getting the UI for the pipelines into GitWorkshop, which would be the perfect place for it. He's in the middle of a rewrite, so when that is progressing a bit more we'll cooperate on making this part of it, stay tuned!\n\n## Whoami\nI started by creating a service that would run on every TollGate router that a client can use to fetch their own MAC address that's later included in the payment. The MAC address is the anchor for the router to allow/disallow access. The problem we have on Android is that the operating system restricts access to this information. But since we control the router, we can work around it by creating a predictable endpoint that gives us back this answer.\n\n## Beacon frames\nRouters use something called Beacon Frames, which are sent out regularly and it is the thing your phone looks at when scanning for wifi networks. It contains the name of the network (SSID) and a whole bunch of other stuff you don't usually see. \n\nWe're utilising these beacon frames to add some information specific to tollgates. There is a field in these beacon frames called 'vendor elements'. Which is originally only intended for use by manufacturers of routers. But ofcourse we can utilize them too. Which is exactly what we do. \n\nI eperimented with these beacon frames to see how many of them we can broadcast. It turns out that we're limited to only one of them, but the good news is we can fit up to 249 characters (256 - a few reserved ones) in there.\nThis is amazing because it will fit everything we need in there.\n\nWe put in:\n- Nostr npub\n- TollGate version\n- Gateway IP (required to get around OS limitations)\n- allocationType (KiB/Minutes)\n- price per 1024 units (eg: 104900 sats per 1024 KiB)\n- price units (sat)\n\nSo now any tollgate can broadcast this info, which is used by clients to decide wether or not they should connect. And if they do, where the payment should go.\n\n## Suggestions, Suggestions, Suggestions\nUnfortunately, Android in the past few years has locked down the wifi api's and we can no longer fully autoconnect to networks. Instead we have to use the 'wifi suggestions' API. As the name implies, it will only suggest a nework to a user using a silent notification that they have to press to actually connect. But alas, we'll work with that and if it's the only user-action required, that's still quite okay.\n\nIt took me quite a while to figure out the way the OS handles these suggestions, but eventually I got it to work and was able to get the flow to work! \n\n## Adding the payment\nOk this part doesn't include an actual payment yet, but all the components are in place now for a (semi-)automatic tollgate connection, which is EPIC!\nIn this version i still manually tap 'connect', but this can and will be automatic soon.\n\nSo the steps are as follows (this happens in a few seconds):\n- 📲 TollGate App scans for networks and filters for TollGates\n- 👤 User taps Connect [to be automated]\n- 📲 TollGate App suggests network\n- 👤 User taps suggestion notification to connect\n- 🤖 Android connects to network\n- 📲 TollGate App fetches it's own MAC address (whoami service on router)\n- 📲 TollGate App Connects to Nostr relay (running on the router)\n- 📲 TollGate App Sends payment\n- 🛜 Router receives payment (merchant module)\n- 🛜 Router creates session (merchant module)\n- 🛜 Router opens the gate for user (valve module)\n- 🛜 Router closes the gate for user, when purchase runs out (valve module)\n\nI made this recording, it has a small caveat that at the end the page loaded because I was on 5g, the OS still thought the wifi network had a captive portal open. But there's an API to mark it as dismissed, which we can easily implement.

So anyway I ended up publishing it and sharing it with all of you.\n\nnostr:nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzpwa4mkswz4t8j70s2s6q00wzqv7k7zamxrmj2y4fs88aktcfuf68qy88wumn8ghj7mn0wvhxcmmv9uq3zamnwvaz7tmwdaehgu3wwa5kuef0qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyv9kh2uewd9hj7qpqzskk7na9x9cgnzpvz7xufdn2y8wqxf00rnq7jg75z86lk30l6plspy9e9u\n\n## Pipeline runner\n\n### The plan\nI can't believe all of this happened just this week. I worked out a plan with nostr:npub16ux4qzg4qjue95vr3q327fzata4n594c9kgh4jmeyn80v8k54nhqg6lra7 to first create a DVM that would be able to clone a given ngit(!) repository and just print the contents of any given pipeline `.yaml` file that resides inside that repository.\n\nThe DVM would have the following inputs\n- git url (or Nostr address)\n- branch\n- pipeline (path to yaml)\n\n### Proof of Concept\nI was able to repurpose a dvm-git-watcher that i'd created earlier to create the DVM to run the pipeline. Created a POC where the CI runner actually takes the pipeline, executes it and gives back a response and decided to put up a little video demo:\n\nhttps://cdn.satellite.earth/43463990dd11c9506989e5eda915757cf3ec1b32e8d472579cd2ee18d5685f0d.mp4\n\n### Some improvements\nWednesday I added a NIP-89 announcement to the DVM where it just advertizes its existence in hopes of some validation that it is real, and that it is actually useful, and it hopes to be used and talk with other npubs to not be lonely...\n\nSo then i figured it was time to package it into an easier to distribute package, a Docker container. That would allow me to include the required tools, namely ngit-cli and the 'act' cli (used to run the pipeline).\n\n### Troubles 😱\nAdding the precompiled version of ngit got me into trouble with this error:\n\n```shell\nError: Cloning into 'tmp/1ca8af464df5fc648b77db14e0e5e35ff64d6627a690e138e19298dd56573274'...\n          /app/ngit//git-remote-nostr: /usr/local/lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.38' not found (required by /app/ngit//git-remote-nostr)\n          /app/ngit//git-remote-nostr: /usr/local/lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.39' not found (required by /app/ngit//git-remote-nostr)\n          fatal: remote helper 'nostr' aborted session\n```\n\nI didn't really know how to proceed as it could be a Docker issue, a Deno issue, or an ngit issue.\n\nLuckily nostr:npub16ux4qzg4qjue95vr3q327fzata4n594c9kgh4jmeyn80v8k54nhqg6lra7 knows his shit and saved me here. It turned out to be an issue that had to do with the ngit binary. Because ngit is compiled on a recent ubuntu version, it depended on some packages that the linux version my Docker image was based on did not have. Thus it failed.\n\nOur solution was to compile ngit instead of using the existing binary, which took some trial and error to get working but eventually it did. It slowed down the build process significantly but alas, at least it works now!\n\n### Moving on\nAfter ngit worked I added the 'act' runner to the docker image and was able to control the host system's docker so it can run the isolated environments that have the pipelines run inside.\n\nAnd so I was able to package up the thing, able to run on any machine, which led me to this little demo:\n\nnostr:nevent1qqs9486y7cs6a9h7n4sk7sdv52qvuqyp80rj0eyg6zt7htfyt9wh4wgpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mqpz3mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfdupzpwa4mkswz4t8j70s2s6q00wzqv7k7zamxrmj2y4fs88aktcfuf68g4v3lk\n\nThe only issue I still have is getting the output of the pipeline properly fed back to the user. But that's some magic with log streams that I have zero experience with, so that's a nice challenge for next week! If you or anyone you know is a Stream magician, please let me know!\n\nSee you there!","sig":"ae315fc076ab0a5eda011153bc2be12cbb4373c02fbf2fc6750feb2c0a739d20ec01e1f040c1f7077009aa6d66f6201295527892310bfdf0b73ae6ff30fbf18e"},"naddr1qqg8x6rfd3kxjmn894eksmmswd68yqgswaehxw309ahx7um5wgh8w6twv5pzph68s45y080zdd9g8sdacnd6kcd4ejpwrgcju2eghjq45y4f28n8qvzqqqr4gu2zjl6r":{"kind":30023,"id":"2b205e6457256ba9078b6143cfe5d518bcf389918220cca51967ae397d602267","pubkey":"df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67","created_at":1738201800,"tags":[["d","shilling-shopstr"],["title","Shilling Shopstr"],["summary","Shopstr is a free, open-source online marketplace that uses the nostr protocol and allows sellers to accept bitcoin payments through the cashu protocol.

It's like a Facebook marketplace or Etsy on the [nostr protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr). It is free and open-source software, not a corporation. Sellers can sell goods and services for bitcoin using the privacy-preserving [cashu protocol]( https://cashu.space/).\n\nI set my store up a few weeks ago, but didn't have any idea as to WTF I could sell. I shoved it further down my ToDo list until I was inspired by [Cyan Banister](https://fountain.fm/episode/UOpZ1IfUl98Qz4jDORi2). She went from a homeless teenager/high school dropout to a VC who made a bunch of money as an early investor in SpaceX. I highly recommend listening to as many of her guest appearances on podcasts as you can.\n\nShe said she learned about capitalism by selling surplus pecans her grandparents sent her. She tried selling pecans for $7.00. If nobody bought them, she would lower the price to $6.00. That sparked an idea in my brain like a firecracker on the 4th of July. What if I sold cashews for cashu?\n\n## Cashews 4 Cashu\n\nI bought some organic, whole cashews and roasted them with 3 ingredients:\nBeef Tallow(bitcoin nerds don't like seed oils)\nSalt\nGarlic powder.\n![cashews](https://gitea.marc26z.com/marc/Marc26z/raw/branch/main/Cashu1/Screenshot_20250129_095526_Kiwi%20Browser.jpg)\n\nI packaged them in one-ounce servings using a FoodSaver vacuum sealer. Then, I wrote the block height from when I took them out of the oven and put them on sale for $7.00.\n\nI also know bitcoiners love \"sats back.\" I know a lot of dudes who use the Fold card to earn as many sats back as they can. I decided to do the same thing by offering 10% cashu back. I will take 10% of the total and create an ecash voucher. For example, if someone buys my nuts for 7,000 sats, I will send my nuts(pun intended) with a QR code they can scan with an ecash wallet like [minibits](https://github.com/minibits-cash/minibits_wallet) for 700 sats back. **It's paper money that is backed by bitcoin.**\n\nSince this is very new, I figure some folks might need help so I added a link to my Zendesk-esque ticketing system. I run Peppermint on a Docker container on my PopOS! desktop. I don't know what ZenDesk costs, but this is a great alternative for a micro-business.\n\nI don't expect to disrupt the online cashew market. **My goal is to gain help desk experience to get a better job**. If I can make some extra sats on the side, that would be awesome!\n\nWant to try my cashews for cashu?\nCheck out my merch store and buy some for yourself.\n\n☮️npub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0\n\n[881,431](https://mempool.marc26z.com/block/000000000000000000027ade0e16eb38ca276883e8d4a76f2e8bc26c5637de7c)\n\n[Shop My Merch Store](nostr:npub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g)\n","sig":"31b785e2a3bc84cab4f31ba7f4f88b46f9dd408836927cc701136cdbd7709ecd636f4670b4cc67c62f2dd75044d3c52d1f1a99028f890fd6285efcaa20ffdd47"},"naddr1qqgkzttdv968getj94hkvttvd9nksaqpzemhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuurjd9kkzmpwdejhgq3qc8n9qhqzm2x3kzjm84kmdcvm96ezmn257r5xxphv3gsnjq4nz4lqxpqqqp65w2xcpv3":{"kind":30023,"id":"e1e18f506a7d6061e483322695f72b6687c3944f21989f310e111b9390d153af","pubkey":"c1e6505c02da8d1b0a5b3d6db6e19b2eb22dcd54f0e86306ec8a213902b3157e","created_at":1745981455,"tags":[["d","a-matter-of-light"],["title","A Matter of Light"],["summary","Another string of thoughts on photography."],["image","https://i.nostr.build/dzUEtE5a1gTuo4HU.jpg"],["published_at","1745981455"],["t","nostr"],["t","photography"],["t","pictureroom"],["t","leica"]],"content":"Photography, to me, is a game - a game of snatching absurd, beautiful, fleeting moments from life. Anything staged or overly polished falls into what Garry Winogrand nails as “illustration work.” I’m with him on that. Photography is about staying awake to the world, to the “physical reality” or circumstances we’re steeped in, and burning that light onto film emulsion (or pixels now), locking a moment into matter forever. It’s not like painting, where brushstrokes mimic what’s seen, felt, or imagined. Photography captures photons - light itself - and turns it into something tangible. The camera, honestly, doesn’t get enough credit for being such a wild invention.\n\nLately, I’ve been chewing on what to do with a batch of new photos I’ve shot over the past month, which includes photographs from a film project, a trip to Manhattan and photos of David Byrne (more on that in another post). Maybe it's another photo-zine that I should make. It’s been a minute since my last one, Hiding in Hudson (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7_t0OldrTk\u0026t=339s). Putting out printed work like zines or books is killer practice — it forces you to sharpen your compositions, your vision, your whole deal as a photographer. Proof of work, you know?\n\nThis leads to a question: anyone out there down to help or collab on printing a photo-zine? I’d love to keep it DIY, steering clear of big companies.\n\nIn the spirit of getting back into a rhythm of daily shooting, here are a few recent shots from the past few days.

OpenSea’s sudden regulatory relief and strategic transformation are just the beginning.\n\n## The SEC’s Curious Retreat\n\nLet’s start with the smoking gun: the SEC was investigating OpenSea for unregistered securities violations, even issuing a Wells notice in August 2024. Then, in a complete reversal, they dropped the case without explanation. This wasn’t some random bureaucratic oversight—it happened right after Trump took office.\n\nThe timing is too perfect. His administration wasted no time signaling its pro-crypto stance, and the SEC, once an enforcer, is now rolling over like a neutered watchdog.\n\u003e The message? As long as you’re playing the “crypto-bro” game, the rules don’t apply.\n\n## OpenSea’s Convenient Pivot\n\nWith the regulatory threat gone, OpenSea immediately rebranded itself—not just as an NFT marketplace but a full-blown token trading platform. Here’s what they did:\n* Launched OS2, a rebuilt exchange expanding into token trading.\n* Dropped the SEA token on February 13, 2025—perfectly timed with the regulatory climate shift.\n* Slashed fees to near zero to attract volume and dominate the market.\n\nThis wasn’t just a business move—it was a power play. OpenSea knew that under the previous administration, tokenizing its platform might have triggered another securities probe. But under Trump’s SEC? It’s open season.\n\n## Wash Trading and Market Manipulation\n\nAnd it worked. The SEA token launch sent OpenSea’s market share skyrocketing from 25.5% to 71.5% in just four weeks. Daily trading volume exploded from $3.47 million to $17.4 million—but the numbers don’t add up. The surge was so artificial that OpenSea had to suspend its XP-based incentives system after accusations of wash trading flooded in.\n\n### Let’s be clear: this isn’t real market growth. This is manipulation.\n\nBy incentivizing rapid-fire, circular trading, OpenSea created the illusion of demand. The goal? Pump the SEA token, dominate competitors, and make insiders rich—at the expense of everyday traders.\n\n## Who’s Really Benefiting?\n\nThe financials paint a grim picture. #Coatue Management, once a major investor, slashed OpenSea’s valuation from $13.3 billion to just $1.4 billion. Trading volume has collapsed from its $5 billion peak to just $190 million per month. And yet, insiders are doubling down.\n\nConsider these strategic moves:\n\t* OpenSea relocated from New York to Miami, aligning with Florida’s looser regulatory environment.\n* It established a foundation in the Cayman Islands—a classic move for dodging scrutiny.\n\t* It’s benefiting from a hands-off #SEC, which has abandoned enforcement actions under the new administration.\n\nThis is the new crypto economy: a lawless Wild West where the biggest players game the system while retail traders foot the bill.\n\n## What Comes Next?\n\nWith #Trump’s administration actively reshaping crypto regulation, OpenSea is the first of many companies to exploit this new reality. We’re entering an era where politically connected #crypto firms will enjoy total freedom to manipulate markets, while ordinary investors will be left holding the bag.\n\n### The lesson? If you’re not on the inside, you’re the exit liquidity.\n\nThis isn’t just about #OpenSea.

Not because it was unworkable, but because it was unwanted. #Gaza, they say, is \"uninhabitable.\" The solution? Depopulation, disguised as development.\n\n## The Riviera Plan: Rebuilding Without Its People\n\nNational Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes put it bluntly:\n\n\"Gaza is uninhabitable.\"\n\nThis isn't a call for humanitarian intervention. It's a pretext for forced displacement.\n\nTrump's vision transforms Gaza into a \"Riviera of the #MiddleEast\"—after its population has been relocated. Officials have explicitly stated Palestinians \"would not be allowed to return\" once reconstruction begins. This isn't rebuilding; it's replacement.\n\n## Regional Consensus Rejected\n\nThe Arab League's proposal represented rare unity among regional powers. It offered a detailed roadmap for reconstruction while allowing #Palestinians to remain in their homeland.\n\nBy dismissing this plan, Washington sent a clear message: **Palestinian self-determination remains subordinate to Western geopolitical interests.**\n\nThis isn't new. For over a century, Western capitals have determined Palestinian futures while treating their voices as irrelevant.\n\n## The Fiat War Machine Connection\n\nWar and fiat money go hand in hand.

A world \"perpetually lurching from one crisis to another, with devastating consequences for humanity.\"\n\n## Ukraine Parallels: When Support Is Conditional\n\nThe U.S. has now halted military aid to #Ukraine, suspending over $1 billion in arms. #Europe scrambles to fill the gap, suddenly realizing the conditional nature of American protection.\n\nBoth conflicts reveal the same truth: **geopolitical support is increasingly transactional rather than values-based.**\n\nAs Henry Kissinger observed: \"It may be dangerous to be America's enemy, but being America's friend can be fatal.\"\n\n## The Cycle Continues\n\nThe U.S. model is simple: fund destruction, control reconstruction, keep the cycle going.\n\nFiat money makes it possible. Indifference makes it permanent. And yes #Bitcoin can fix it. But will it?\n\nHow long before people wake up #nostr? How long before the cycle breaks?\n\n\"Fiat money is a tool for governments to control their citizens\" as Saifedean rightly says—and now, through endless war, to control the world.","sig":"9947e7e4576fdd0af77c6f91a351fafec22d842e667969c82d6ff7afefa0c041450ae8a17234ed3653aabc81c28d3a74fb4a0eaa943806a2c7b838f02c263f5d"},"naddr1qqgxgetvv46x2enjdakhxetpwf3ksqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qygrhwmpj6jcar69l92tt40458tv6mc2hh5mrmzdc07mrumc524vg3qpsgqqqw4rs07fedd":{"kind":30023,"id":"62f06c1ba1ac10a593e6d89f85974729765d2bc2433e337ceb0269d2dc092eac","pubkey":"7776c32d4b1d1e8bf2a96babeb43ad9ade157bd363d89b87fb63e6f145558888","created_at":1746106918,"tags":[["d","deletefromsearch"],["title","Primal promises to never fix the search features I paid for"],["summary","Primal \"legends\" aren't"],["t","nostr"],["t","Primal Legends"],["t","gangstalking"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/3e5eb2c52fcb94c62fedf29a2677f6aba250ba2528820d336020014ea3c37179.jpg "],["published_at","1746106910"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqamkcvk5k8g730e2j6atadp6mxk7z4aaxc7cnwrlkclx79z4tzygqqgxgetvv46x2enjdakhxetpwf3ksat9svd"],["p","532d830dffe09c13e75e8b145c825718fc12b0003f61d61e9077721c7fff93cb"],["p","123afae7d187ba36d6ddcd97dbf4acc59aeffe243f782592ff8f25ed579df306"],["p","04c915daefee38317fa734444acee390a8269fe5810b2241e5e6dd343dfbecc9"],["p","1afe0c74e3d7784eba93a5e3fa554a6eeb01928d12739ae8ba4832786808e36d"],["p","3f770d65d3a764a9c5cb503ae123e62ec7598ad035d836e2a810f3877a745b24"]],"content":"The nostr:npub12vkcxr0luzwp8e673v29eqjhrr7p9vqq8asav85swaepclllj09sylpugg Android app will no longer load anything for me at all, as of today.\n\nMuch worse and harder to fix, they have added a \"delete\" feature before fixing the \"advanced search\" functionality for my account. They also haven't given me any answers on the topic since nostr:npub1zga04e73s7ard4kaektaha9vckdwll3y8auztyhl3uj764ua7vrqc7ppvc told me he \"couldn't repro\" and left it at that.\n\nThe so-called \"delete\" feature is of course not actually able to reliably delete posts from nostr. It will probably hide posts from Primal's so-called \"advanced search\" but a more honest \"hide post from Primal users and remove Primal's infrastructure from efforts to publicly preserve it\" button would be more embarrassing for a VC-funded corporatist nostr app to implement.\n\nThis means the \"advanced search\" will never be reliable for me, when it was one of the most essential features I paid over a million sats for, the day Primal \"legends\" launched. Despite me being a day-1 subscriber, Primal spent the first several months ignoring my posts on the topic and keeping me blocked from search functionality to make it harder for me to use this feature to help find evidence in disputes, as I paid to be able to do; and now they've added post deletions before fixing it, so whenever they finally do \"fix\" it, I will still need to use a different tool in order to find posts others deny making, since this one allows the posts to simply be gone.\n\nBeing a Primal \"legend\" also no longer means you'll stand by your past statements and face scrutiny for them. Of course, it never did, since tons of Primal \"legends\" are high-follower npubs who have me muted. But at least their \"legend\" subscriptions meant they contributed to fund the infrastructure to help Primal keep posts forever, with no deleting.\n\nNow, it seems like I'm the only one who had that intention. The really influential \"legends\" never wanted a permanent record to show their statements could face scrutiny. People like nostr:npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8l9sy9jys09umwng00manysew95gx + nostr:npub1rtlqca8r6auyaw5n5h3l5422dm4sry5dzfee4696fqe8s6qgudks7djtfs + nostr:npub18ams6ewn5aj2n3wt2qawzglx9mr4nzksxhvrdc4gzrecw7n5tvjqctp424 and others saw me trying to hold them accountable. I'm guessing at least one of them wanted to be able to block me from using search functionality, to make it harder for me to find my past conversations with them, or their past posts on a given topic. They seem like people who would be happy I was blocked from that functionality for a long enough time to roll out post deletions and make sure the issue could never really be fixed for me. Or maybe every high-follower npub is one of those people, since none of them have really helped me with this by reposting my posts about it or anything.\n\nIn the mean time, did they fund other projects that help ensure a controllable record?\n\nDid any of my fellow Primal \"legends\" give a million sats to some other project to run a nostr search engine with the same filtering options, and a permanent record of past posts? No. There is no other nostr search engine with the same filtering options and a permanent record of past posts. I can't fund such a project alone.\n\nDo I have a tool I can use to easily make backups of a list of npubs and search their posts locally, with the same kind of filtering options, on my own system? Also no.\n\nMy best bet for reviewing my past interactions with an npub is now the list of all interactions in jumble.social which takes a while to dig through, but it's a welcome addition to nostr. Much better than nothing. Nostr.band is still my best bet for finding a given npub's past posts on a given topic. \n\nWhere are posts being stored forever right now? Hopefully more than enough relays, but apparently not Primal's. Maybe not enough overall.\n\nMy guess is, some posts will continue to end up being lost forever, or too obfuscated to find with whatever search tools I have available. Sometimes, these will probably be disputed posts that the original posters deny making, and I wouldn't be surprised if one of those posters turned out to be a so-called \"Primal legend\" - which isn't what those words were supposed to mean when I paid a million sats for permanent post archival and search access on a decentralized, censorship-resistant social media app.\n\nOf course, the number 1 reason I paid for Primal \"legends\" was to make it more embarrassing for them to censor me. At the time, it seemed like they were making the app's cache connection much slower and less reliable for me than other users, and silently filtering my posts and/or notifications for other users. I assumed they would find it too embarrassing to keep being so blatant about this, and that has worked so far. They clearly still target me, perhaps as intensely as before, but not as blatantly.","sig":"c40278ed04b8cc050905415507787978aa17b180dd2615dc0c465e77985540883a3676cbf6986244a980cb165050683217fc5d5e51610c186cafd6cdc3302ad2"},"naddr1qqgxummnw3ez6ct594ekxctvv5knzqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qygzjkjs8d09mhhp6rth6xu6czm8hfxfmrwxmyq4srjyrck9707kch5psgqqqw4rszjfnrv":{"kind":30023,"id":"13d798358ed8ecc37bfa2d27cc18a143f3d3f08b53a5333a8cd894d1ca5b06eb","pubkey":"52b4a076bcbbbdc3a1aefa3735816cf74993b1b8db202b01c883c58be7fad8bd","created_at":1746309285,"tags":[["d","nostr-at-scale-1"],["title","Nostr at Scale: Moving events at over 100K events/s"],["summary","How we imported millions of Nostr events at scale, in under half an hour.\nOr, stress testing production on a Friday.

Part of this involves processing a large amount of Nostr events for features such as search, analytics, and feeds.\n\nI have been recently developing `nosdex` v3, a newer version of the Noswhere scraper that is designed for maximum performance and fault tolerance using FoundationDB (FDB).\n\nFishcake has been working on a processing system for Nostr events to use with NB, based off of Cloudflare (CF) Pipelines, which is a relatively new beta product. This evening, we put it all to the test.\n\n## First preparations\n\nWe set up a new CF Pipelines endpoint, and I implemented a basic importer that took data from the `nosdex` database. This was quite slow, as it did HTTP requests synchronously, but worked as a good smoke test.\n\n### Asynchronous indexing\n\nI implemented a high-contention queue system designed for highly parallel indexing operations, built using FDB, that supports:\n- Fully customizable batch sizes\n- Per-index queues\n- Hundreds of parallel consumers\n- Automatic retry logic using lease expiration\n\nWhen the scraper first gets an event, it will process it and eventually write it to the *blob store* and FDB. Each new event is appended to the *event log*.\n\nOn the indexing side, a `Queuer` will read the event log, and batch events (usually 2K-5K events) into one work job. This work job contains:\n- A range in the log to index\n- Which target this job is intended for\n- The size of the job and some other metadata\n\nEach job has an associated leasing state, which is used to handle retries and prioritization, and ensure no duplication of work.\n\nSeveral `Worker`s monitor the index queue (up to 128) and wait for new jobs that are available to lease.\n\nOnce a suitable job is found, the worker acquires a lease on the job and reads the relevant events from FDB and the blob store.\n\nDepending on the indexing type, the job will be processed in one of a number of ways, and then marked as completed or returned for retries.\n\n_In this case, the event is also forwarded to CF Pipelines._\n\n![](https://i.nostr.build/mbtSbDu4JHCSJlZt.png)\n\n## Trying it out\n\nThe first attempt did not go well. I found a bug in the high-contention indexer that led to frequent transaction conflicts. This was easily solved by correcting an incorrectly set parameter.\n\nWe also found there were other issues in the indexer, such as an insufficient amount of threads, and a suspicious decrease in the speed of the `Queuer` during processing of queued jobs.\n\nAlong with fixing these issues, I also implemented other optimizations, such as deprioritizing `Worker` DB accesses, and increasing the batch size.\n\nTo fix the degraded `Queuer` performance, I ran the backfill job by itself, and then started indexing after it had completed.\n\n## Bottlenecks, bottlenecks everywhere\n![](https://image.nostr.build/3aebc2aa10fe367c7e8620f3893493b554924ef186042d2b36407cb8d6984723.png)\n\nAfter implementing these fixes, there was an interesting problem: The DB couldn't go over 80K reads per second. I had encountered this limit during load testing for the scraper and other FDB benchmarks.\n\nAs I suspected, this was a client thread limitation, as one thread seemed to be using high amounts of CPU. To overcome this, I created a new client instance for each `Worker`.\n\nAfter investigating, I discovered that the Go FoundationDB client cached the database connection. This meant all attempts to create separate DB connections ended up being useless.\n\nUsing `OpenWithConnectionString` partially resolved this issue. (This also had benefits for service-discovery based connection configuration.)\n\nTo be able to fully support multi-threading, I needed to enabled the FDB multi-client feature. Enabling it also allowed easier upgrades across DB versions, as FDB clients are incompatible across versions:\n\n\u003e `FDB_NETWORK_OPTION_EXTERNAL_CLIENT_LIBRARY=\"/lib/libfdb_c.so\"`\n\u003e `FDB_NETWORK_OPTION_CLIENT_THREADS_PER_VERSION=\"16\"`\n\n## Breaking the 100K/s reads barrier\n\n![](https://i.nostr.build/IPt2sDYVAt9HA7oQ.png)\n\nAfter implementing support for the multi-threaded client, **we were able to get over 100K reads per second.**\n\nYou may notice after the restart (gap) the performance dropped. This was caused by several bugs:\n1. When creating the CF Pipelines endpoint, we did not specify a region. The automatically selected region was far away from the server.\n2. The amount of shards were not sufficient, so we increased them.\n3. The client overloaded a few HTTP/2 connections with too many requests.\n\nI implemented a feature to assign each `Worker` its own HTTP client, fixing the 3rd issue. We also moved the entire storage region to West Europe to be closer to the servers.\n\nAfter these changes, we were able to easily push over 200K reads/s, mostly limited by missing optimizations:\n\n![](https://i.nostr.build/ZOQ7l61ZTSEMOMKb.png)\n\n## It's shards all the way down\n\nWhile testing, we also noticed another issue: At certain times, a pipeline would get overloaded, stalling requests for seconds at a time. This prevented all forward progress on the `Worker`s.\n\nWe solved this by having multiple pipelines: A primary pipeline meant to be for standard load, with moderate batching duration and less shards, and high-throughput pipelines with more shards.\n\nEach `Worker` is assigned a pipeline on startup, and if one pipeline stalls, other workers can continue making progress and saturate the DB.\n\n## The stress test\n\nAfter making sure everything was ready for the import, we cleared all data, and started the import.\n\nThe entire import lasted 20 minutes between 01:44 UTC and 02:04 UTC, reaching a peak of:\n- 0.25M requests per second\n- 0.6M keys read per second\n- 140MB/s reads from DB\n- 2Gbps of network throughput\n\nFoundationDB ran smoothly during this test, with:\n- Read times under 2ms\n- Zero conflicting transactions\n- No overloaded servers\n\nCF Pipelines held up well, delivering batches to R2 without any issues, while reaching its maximum possible throughput.\n\n![](https://i.nostr.build/sXBJa7qhvd80CaTp.png)\n\n## Finishing notes\n\nMe and Fishcake have been building infrastructure around scaling Nostr, from media, to relays, to content indexing. We consistently work on improving scalability, resiliency and stability, even outside these posts.\n\nMany things, including what you see here, are already a part of Nostr.build, Noswhere and NFDB, and many other changes are being implemented every day.\n\nIf you like what you are seeing, and want to integrate it, get in touch. :)\n\nIf you want to support our work, you can zap this post, or register for [nostr.land](https://nostr.land) and [nostr.build](https://getnb.me/87E7-01E9-790C) today.\n","sig":"f6a1bb966d44d8aa7a0e109f965072a15013507422f4b7786c4608e04787c718afc97e7e60ba6b61ab81ee76065474514de3574350c1fafa3ba2945d5efccd31"},"naddr1qqgxymr4v4ekk7fdweej6mn0wd68yqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qygqyv87tanzvxd6y8xfj66u0zynfendhejtn44a9pt3k9kcntfr5m5psgqqqw4rsqx5hux":{"kind":30023,"id":"66f6030a4e2978acf04c58922de139b9872b0ef1dd9df7b160c53fea81e152f1","pubkey":"0461fcbecc4c3374439932d6b8f11269ccdb7cc973ad7a50ae362db135a474dd","created_at":1741907412,"tags":[["d","bluesky-vs-nostr"],["title","Bluesky vs Nostr"],["summary","Let's compare Bluesky and Nostr to see how they stack up."],["published_at","1741907412"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqprpljlvcnpnw3pejvkkhrc3y6wvmd7vjuad0fg2ud3dky66gaxaqqykkmn00qkkyet5vyhjuvda"],["t","nostr"],["t","atproto"],["t","bluesky"],["t","bsky"]],"content":"## Background\n\nI will start with a disclaimer: I'm all-in on Nostr. But before that, I spent 4 years building on ActivityPub. Then in Feb 2023 I built a bridge between ActivityPub and Nostr, and in Dec 2024 I built another bridge between Nostr and Bluesky. Most of all I am committed to open source and the decentralized vision. Having experience with all 3 major protocols, I still think Nostr is the best, but Bluesky outshines it in some major areas. The main reason for this blog is to explore the things Bluesky does better than us, and to point out why I still think Nostr is the best solution.\n\nThis is a technical blog. For a more high level overview of decentralized protocols, see: https://soapbox.pub/blog/comparing-protocols/\n\n## Data Model\n\nNostr and Bluesky both allow users to store any type of data in a single, unified format. Nostr calls them *events*. Bluesky calls them *records*. They are mostly interchangeable ideas, but the way the data is stored and retrieved is very different.\n\nIt's worth noting that, like Nostr and ActivityPub, Bluesky is capable of doing anything under the sun. It's a misconception that it can't. You can build whatever Reddit, TikTok, or other stuff clone on Bluesky just fine. It's limited more by the huge knowledge gap you have to overcome than it is by anything about its data model.\n\n### NSIDs vs Kinds\n\nNostr events use a \"kind\" number, eg `1`, to distinguish different type of events. Bluesky records use what they call an \"NSID\" (namespace identifier), eg `app.bsky.feed.post`, which is a reverse-DNS string notation.\n\nNostr's `\"kind\": 1` is equivalent to Bluesky's `\"$type\": app.bsky.feed.post`.\n\nI think Bluesky's system is better, because it allows developers to feel like what they built is \"real\" without having to get it merged into the NIPs repo, which is basically like an IANA of Nostr kind numbers. I believe this causes significant problems on Nostr, and makes people feel like they are being held back by others. That being said, the counter-argument is that kind numbers encourage interoperability for the very same reasons. The barriers to adding new kinds pushes people to work with what's already there.\n\n### Text Content Formatting\n\nKind 1 events (\"plain text notes\", ie \"Tweets\") on Nostr have developed in a haphazard way over time, by many people piling things onto it without taking a step back to assess a unified way to handle it. Some examples include:\n\n- NIP-21 `nostr:` URIs\n- `imeta` tags\n- inline media embeds as URLs without `imeta` tags\n- unspec'd Markdown rendering by some clients\n- legacy specs such as positional mentions (eg, `#[0]`, mostly gone now)\n\nWhat we have now is quite a mess, and it's something Bluesky beats us on badly.\n\nBluesky has a plaintext content field that can be displayed as-is. In addition, it has a \"[facets](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/post-richtext)\" field, which is a structured JSON object, that adds rich-text information such as formatting (bold, italic, etc), links, mentions of users, and whatever else metadata about the text.\n\nThis is an extensible system that beats even options like Markdown, due to its ability to include native extension like mentions, and its ability to be parsed by any programming language or software environment.\n\nBluesky is the winner here.\n\n### Syncronization\n\nNostr and Bluesky are both thought to be descended from Scuttlebutt, an older decentralized protocol.\n\nOn Scuttlebutt, a user's whole post history needed to be available for them to make a new post. Scuttlebutt uses a linked list, so each new event would need to reference the one before it. Only linear paths are allowed, so if a \"fork\" occurred (intentionally or not), only one version would be kept, and the other discarded. This lead to occasional publishing issues, but it allowed readers to assemble a complete view.\n\nNostr strayed from this draconian approach, removing it entirely and allowing user data to be fragmented. Meanwhile Bluesky, instead of removing it entirely, made it work more like git so that branches could be merged.\n\nBoth approaches have tradeoffs. Bluesky's approach has much higher complexity. Also, it's sometimes considered an advantage for events to be fragmented (eg Nostr allows sending DMs to specialized relays for enhanced privacy).\n\nBut Bluesky has a true account \"sync\" mechanism, and Nostr does not. Nostr can send filters to relays to gather events, but it cannot know when to stop looking. Proposals like Negentropy in Nostr do not solve author syncing, and only make typical relay filtering more efficient.\n\nI think it's important to think about Nostr's \"outbox\" problem as a syncronization problem, and for Nostr to approach syncronization with the goal of syncronizing authors specifically.\n\nI think Bluesky \"wins\" this one, if only because they have solved a problem that we haven't. Instead of copying their solution, I think Nostr should try to learn from this to recharacterize the \"outbox\" problem as an author syncing problem, and see if we can come up with a better solution that works for Nostr.\n\n## Knowledge Gap\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles of Bluesky, and by extension one of the greates appeals of Nostr, is in how easy it is to learn and build on.\n\nNostr can be understood in a couple of hours. Mastering it is difficult, but limited only by your time and imagination. Hundreds of developers are building new projects on Nostr today. Based on my experience, it seems to me that the Nostr developer community is larger than that of both ActivityPub and Bluesky combined.\n\nBluesky on the other hand requires a Harvard degree in Blueskyology. I believe that ameteur coders feel a sense of superiority after spending six weeks learning how to commit a post. To learn Bluesky you will have to sift through thousands of technical documents about all kinds of abstractions, especially related to IPFS and IPLD. You will have to master unnecessary technologies like CBOR (which is basically just JSON except it's in binary and takes up the same amount of space). And you will be frequently pointed to academic topics such as \"DAG\" and \"graph theory\", all just to say \"it's a fucking graph\". I will never understand why people will take simple concepts such as a \"tree\", and then make it harder to understand on purpose by saying it's more than that.\n\nWhile building on Bluesky, I began to question if the creators did this on purpose. I wondered if they tried to make it complex on purpose, as a sort of IQ test and protective measure to weed out the undeireables. In my view, a truly free and open network must be accessible to all, with the hope that even non-programmers could learn how it works.\n\nTechnical complexity is not just an issue of inclusion, but also security. ActivityPub software has been found to be littered with major security holes due to its inherently complex design, while Nostr's simple design makes its attack surface extremely minimal. Bluesky has already had a few mishaps, and it makes me wonder how Bluesky will fare in the long term.\n\n## Decentralization\n\nI will keep this short. Bluesky is designed to be decentralized, but isn't. It reminds me of the communist idea about the \"withering away of the state\". The idea is that you're supposed to first sieze power and become the new state, and then under your rule the state will slowly disappear because you are doing all the right communist things. I think this is basically how Bluesky sees itself (whether they agree with the analogy or not).\n\nNostr is decentralized, but it is a loaded gun. You're more likely to kill yourself with a gun than someone else. This is on purpose, because it wholly embraces the consequnces of being truly decentralized.\n\nIn my view Nostr gets it right. Social media has been done to death by now, so I do not think it's worth the compromise to prioritize UX over decentralization. If that's the case we have not fixed anything. It's best to start with the purist idea and work backwards to UX, rather than start with UX and work backwards to decentralization. Many people have already written extensively about the decentralization of Bluesky, so I'll leave it at that.","sig":"03fd4829c4288e9ebf5676bf79d46c12043e5019324b85d7664d67624b3e097fc2c05d2bbc0cd1d55b8e34cf395f5f246275181ba51559fe4b29171e922e03b0"},"naddr1qqgxyvrx8pjnweny8ycr2drpxvekxqg5waehxw309aex2mrp0yhxgctdw4eju6t0qgst3pg6qm0a082glse9yd9pt6dydge2pxp2sga4fn0cy52tnvfqhggrqsqqqa280gjl6t":{"kind":30023,"id":"93cfe30d38f21445497feceda2a52e1df538d12cc38e79344ac68d01a1f6b736","pubkey":"b8851a06dfd79d48fc325234a15e9a46a32a0982a823b54cdf82514b9b120ba1","created_at":1738100094,"tags":[["client","YakiHonne","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["d","b0f8e7fd9054a33c"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/5450ec3883b5df55fb3e9c86450397974bde1e7a4d90cd9707f9436b56732c7a.jpg"],["title","What is Private Property?"],["summary","Property isn’t fences or titles—it’s the heartbeat of human sovereignty.

Even laws against cryptography reach only so far as a nation’s border and the arm of its violence. Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible.\"\nEric Hughes, A Cypherpunk's Manifesto\n\"Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it. If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy. Furthermore, to reveal one’s identity with assurance when the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.\"\n-Eric Hughes, A Cypherpunk's Manifesto\n\"Information longs to be free.\"\n--Stewart Brand\n\"Perhaps you think your email is legitimate enough that encryption is unwarranted. If you really are a law-abiding citizen with nothing to hide, then why don't you always send your paper mail on postcards? Why not submit to drug testing on demand? Why require a warrant for police searches of your house? Are you trying to hide something? If you hide your mail inside envelopes, does that mean you must be a subversive or a drug dealer, or maybe a paranoid nut? Do law-abiding citizens have any need to encrypt their email?\"\nPhil Zimmermann\nWhy I Wrote PGP\nPart of the Original 1991 PGP User's Guide (updated in 1999)\n\"don't be like so many writers,\ndon't be like so many thousands of\npeople who call themselves writers,\ndon't be dull and boring and\npretentious, don't be consumed with self-\nlove.\nthe libraries of the world have\nyawned themselves to\nsleep\nover your kind.\ndon't add to that.\ndon't do it.\"\n-Charles Bukowski\n## On Publishing PGP Ciphertext On Substack\nSubstack allows writers to publish everything to the world or I can lock my work behind a paywall. These two facts are a contradiction I've been trying to square for several years. On one hand, I would like to earn more sats for writing. On the other hand, I want everything I write to be availabe for free because the more accessible my work is, the broader the audience I can reach. The disadvantage with free is I don't get paid. It's a conundrum. Here is my solution.\nAll of my work is available free of charge if you look in the write place. Hint: You can find anything I write in the clear by searching for my npub in a long-form nostr client.\nI also will publish this work on Substack, but some of it will be encrypted with three random words from the EFF long list. These words will be published to my subscribers. If you wish to read an article on Substack, you must decrypt it with a 3-word passphrase made available to my paid subscribers.\nIs it a good idea? I'm not sure.

Serialize and deserialize accounts so they can be saved in local storage or IndexededDB\n - Account manager for multiple accounts and switching between them\n - Account metadata for things like labels, app settings, etc\n - Support for NIP-46 Nostr connect accounts\n\nsee [documentation](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/accounts/manager.html) for more examples\n\n### Nostr connect signer\n\nThe `NostrConnectSigner` class from the `applesauce-signers` package is now in a stable state and has a few new features\n- Ability to create `nostrconnect://` URIs and waiting for the remote signer to connect\n- SDK agnostic way of subscribing and publishing to relays\n\nFor a simple example, here is how to create a signer from a `bunker://`  URI\n```js\nconst signer = await NostrConnectSigner.fromBunkerURI(\n  \"bunker://266815e0c9210dfa324c6cba3573b14bee49da4209a9456f9484e5106cd408a5?relay=wss://relay.nsec.app\u0026secret=d9aa70\",\n  {\n    permissions: NostrConnectSigner.buildSigningPermissions([0, 1, 3, 10002]),\n    async onSubOpen(filters, relays, onEvent) {\n      // manually open REQ\n    },\n    async onSubClose() {\n      // close previouse REQ\n    },\n    async onPublishEvent(event, relays) {\n      // Pubilsh an event to relays\n    },\n  },\n);\n```\n\nsee [documentation](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/signers/nostr-connect.html) for more examples and other signers\n### Event Factory\n\nThe `EventFactory` class is probably what I'm most proud of. its a standalone class that can be used to create various types of events from templates ([blueprints](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/typedoc/modules/applesauce_factory.Blueprints.html)) and is really simple to use\n\nFor example:\n```js\nimport { EventFactory } from \"applesauce-factory\";\nimport { NoteBlueprint } from \"applesauce-factory/blueprints\";\n\nconst factory = new EventFactory({\n  // optionally pass a NIP-07 signer in to use for encryption / decryption\n  signer: window.nostr\n});\n\n// Create a kind 1 note with a hashtag\nlet draft = await factory.create(NoteBlueprint, \"hello world #grownostr\");\n// Sign the note so it can be published\nlet signed = await window.nostr.signEvent(draft);\n```\n\nIts included in the `applesauce-factory` package and can be used with any other nostr SDKs or vanilla javascript\n\nIt also can be used to modify existing replaceable events\n\n```js\nlet draft = await factory.modifyTags(\n  // kind 10002 event\n  mailboxes,\n  // add outbox relays\n  addOutboxRelay(\"wss://relay.io/\"),\n  addOutboxRelay(\"wss://nostr.wine/\"),\n  // remove inbox relay\n  removeInboxRelay(\"wss://personal.old-relay.com/\")\n);\n```\n\nsee [documentation](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/overview/factory.html) for more examples\n### Loaders\n\nThe `applesauce-loaders` package exports a bunch of loader classes that can be used to load everything from replaceable events (profiles) to timelines and NIP-05 identities\n\nThey use [rx-nostr](https://penpenpng.github.io/rx-nostr/) under the hood to subscribe to relays, so for the time being they will not work with other nostr SDKs\n\nI don't expect many other developers or apps to use them since in my experience every nostr client requires a slightly different way or loading events\n\n*They are stable enough to start using but they are not fully tested and they might change slightly in the future*\n\nThe following is a short list of the loaders and what they can be used for\n - `ReplaceableLoader` loads any replaceable events (0, 3, 1xxxx, 3xxxx)\n - `SingleEventLoader`  loads single events based on ids\n - `TimelineLoader` loads a timeline of events from multiple relays based on filters\n - `TagValueLoader` loads events based on a tag name (like \"e\") and a value, can be used to load replies, zaps, reactions, etc\n - `DnsIdentityLoader` loads NIP-05 identities and supports caching\n - `UserSetsLoader` loads all lists events for users\n\nsee [documentation](https://hzrd149.github.io/applesauce/overview/loaders.html) for more examples\n### Real tests\n\nFor all new features and a lot of existing ones I'm trying to write tests to ensure I don't leave unexpected bugs for later\n\nI'm not going to pretend its 100% tests coverage or that it will ever get close to that point, but these tests cover some of the core classes and help me prove that my code is doing what it says its supposed to do\n\nAt the moment there are about 230 tests covering 45 files. not much but its a start\n![](https://cdn.hzrd149.com/e4b560b7c16ec6b8a333ea1a0ba51dfe7c4bde2ecc8647670998e42d8fcbbdb8.png)\n## Apps built using applesauce\n\nIf you want to see some examples of applesauce being used in a nostr client I've been testing a lot of this code in production on the apps I've built in the last few months\n\n - [noStrudel](https://github.com/hzrd149/nostrudel) The main app everything is being built for and tested in\n - [nsite-manager](https://github.com/hzrd149/nsite-manager) Still a work-in-progress but supports multiple accounts thanks to the `applesauce-accounts` package\n -

Some of it is incomprehensible to the average person. But to my mind the more insidious category included terms and phrases that seem to be straightforward, but actually give a completely misleading or wrong impression of what’s happening. It might seem insignificant, but in my opinion a lot of the really destructive wrong ideas about economics and money rely heavily on some misleading jargon that keeps people from understanding the fundamental concepts well enough to spot bad ideas.\n\nThe term I want to explain today is the idea that money “flows into” an asset or asset class. If you read any financial news or headlines, you’ve probably seen some variation of this one a million times. “Money Flowing Into Bonds As Investors Seek Safety.” “Bitcoin ETFs See Large Inflows Today.” You’ve seen it.\n\nOn the surface, this seems logical. It seems like a fair way to describe the action of a lot of people buying something.\n\nThe problem comes because of the implications of the term. When money “flows into” something, that means people are more eager to buy than to sell. That means prices go up. It’s easy to conclude that prices go up because more money is “in” the asset, kind of like dropping quarters in a coffee mug.\n\nIf you think about it for a second you’ll realize it doesn’t work that way, but not nearly enough people take that pause to think. That causes them to have a wrong view of how prices change, and therefore how markets work. That by extension leaves them susceptible to claims from bad actors who want to restrict economic freedom and centrally plan and control trade in the market.\n\n### How Does Money Actually Flow?\n\nMoney flows, but not “into” assets. It flows from person to person. You can almost think of money like financial matter, it can’t be created or destroyed except is specific circumstances.\n\nAny time something is sold, the money flows from the buyer to the seller. Seems obvious, but it’s important to keep it in mind. The money is still there, in the account or wallet of the seller. The amount of money in the economy doesn’t change, only the location of the money. It isn’t destroyed, it isn’t somehow lodged in the house or stock or loaf of bread that was sold, it just flowed from one person to another.\n\n### “Cash on the Sidelines” \n\nThis is another term you might have heard, not the same but a related misunderstanding. Financial commentators will say something like “we expect the market to rise as soon as investor sentiment improves, because there is still a lot of cash on the sidelines waiting to be deployed.” This implies that investors are holding a lot of money, and that they can “put that money into” an asset class and reduce the amount of money “on the sidelines.” The problem is, we understand that if they do buy stocks or bonds or whatever, that money will just flow into the seller’s bank account, and the amount of cash “on the sidelines” won’t change one cent.\n\n### Prices \n\nThis leads to the question of what causes prices to rise, and a fundamental understanding of how a market works. Price is a tricky thing to understand. The price of something is the intersection between the highest amount a buyer is willing to offer, and the lowest amount a seller is willing to accept. If there is no overlap between those points, no price can be established.\n\nIf there are 10 houses on a street, and one goes up for sale, the selling price of that house will be used to “value” the other 9 houses. Say the seller isn’t too desperate to sell, and is willing to wait for a buyer who agrees to pay his asking price of $500,000. If every other house on the street is very similar in size and quality, we would conclude that the value of each of the 10 houses is $500,000. But let’s say another buyer decided $500,000 is a good deal and he’d also like to buy a house on that street. He might go to every owner and offer $500,000, but there’s no guarantee he’ll be able to make a deal. Maybe everyone else is happy with their house, and nobody wants to sell for the price their house is “worth”. So there’s no price, because there’s no intersection between buyer and seller. Maybe the buyer decides he really wants a house, and offers everyone $700,000. Maybe the guy who bought a house for $500,000 last week decides “hey I can make $200,000 in a week for doing nothing, why not?” and sells the house again for $700,000.\n\nLook at what happened to the value of houses. At the first sale, the 10 houses had a combined “value” of $500,000 times 10, or $5 million. Now after the second sale, they have a combined “value” of $7 million, or an increase of $2 million. Headlines would describe that as $700,000 “flowing into” the housing market, but the overall value of those houses, what would be called the “market cap” if we were talking about a company, increased by almost 3x that amount. How does that work? It shows the misleading aspect of “money flowing into” terminology. If money “flowed into” an asset like putting quarters in a piggy bank, it would give the impression that market cap should rise $1 for every dollar of inflow. Obviously that’s not correct, and the reason is that prices don’t work like that. Money inflows are only one factor that can influence prices, and they do so in a much less direct and obvious way than the terminology indicates.\n\n### Market Cap \n\nFor one, there’s a fundamental problem with the way “market cap” is calculated to begin with. It’s supposed to express the value of a group of identical things, typically shares of stock in a company of something similar. But let’s go back to our previous example, the 10 similar houses on a street. The “market cap” of those 10 houses would be given as $5 million dollars after one of them sold for $500,000. But remember, only one house sold, not all ten. A price requires an intersection in agreed value between a buyer and a seller, and that hasn’t occurred with 90% of the houses in this “market”. Suppose one of the houses is owned by a retired couple who intend to spend the rest of their life in that house, and have no need for the money they could get by selling it. Suppose they were offered $2 million dollars, but still weren’t interested in selling. How is that reflected in the market cap calculation? Obviously it isn’t, and just looking at the market cap number by itself would give you the impression that you could buy all ten houses for $5 million. But that might be completely incorrect.\n\nIt could also be incorrect in the other direction. Suppose 5 of the owners on the street suddenly experienced a job loss and had to sell their houses quickly. Could all 5 get $500,000 for their house? Maybe not. After all, the first buyer was the one willing to pay the most for a house there, and there’s no guarantee anyone else will be equally willing to do so. Maybe there are 3 buyers willing to pay $450,000, 1 buyer willing to pay $400,000, and 1 buyer willing to pay $350,000. In that case all 5 houses could be sold, but the last one would have to sell for $350,000 instead of the $500,000 the owners expected to get. If we then do the market cap calculation again, it’s now dropped to $3.5 million. That’s in spite of one house having sold for $500,000, 3 for $450,000, 1 for $400,000, 1 for $350,000, one couple not willing to sell for $2 million, and 3 houses that we know absolutely nothing about yet. To look at a $3.5 million “market cap” tells you none of this very relevant information, while giving you the impression that you know everything you need to know about this market.\n\nWhen you stop and think about it, it’s easy to see that prices can change for all kinds of reasons without any sales occurring at all. Imagine word gets out that a huge corporation is interested in buying all the houses in that neighborhood to make room for a future business expansion. Given the expectation of a highly motivated buyer, all the owners on the street might decide not to sell for less than a million dollars. Did the market cap suddenly rise to $10 million? No houses have been sold yet, so technically it hasn’t. As soon as the first house sells for a million dollars though, it does go to $10 million. So again you gain $5 million in market cap for $1 million in “inflows”.\n\nThis is also relevant when looking at wealth held in stocks and financial assets. For example, Elon Musk holds over 700 million shares of Tesla stock currently “worth” around $135 billion. That amounts to around 20% of all Tesla stock. Now the “value” of that stock is calculated by multiply the number of shares by the last price someone paid for a share. Keeping in mind that price is an intersection between the buyer who’s willing to pay most and the seller who’s willing to accept least, how relevant is this number actually? Say Elon decided to sell all his shares tomorrow, how much is his “wealth” actually worth? How many buyers are willing to pay the last settled price for a share of Tesla stock? Enough to buy 700 million shares? Almost certainly not. So as he started to sell, he’d soon run out of buyers at that level and would have to lower his asking price to get more interest. Of course as soon as he sold a share at a price one dollar lower, the “market cap” of Tesla would fall by about $3.5 billion dollars. And the fact that the company’s largest shareholder is dumping his shares would likely cause a lot of other people to sell as well, which would drive the price they would need to accept even lower. It’s easy to imagine the price falling by double digit percentages, maybe even 80 or 90 percent, if Elon tried to sell in one day. He could easily end up with $50 billion or less for his $135 billion in wealth.\n\n### Why Does It Matter? \n\nThis concept might seem trivial, but there are some features of our economic system that make this money flow principle very important. You should already understand that banks create money by making loans as I explain here, naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp0rve5f6xtu56djkfkkg7ktr5rtfckpun95rgxaa7futy86npx8yqq247t2dvet9q4tsg4qng36lxe6kc4nftayyy89kua2 and that money doesn’t “flow into” assets, but rather a small amount of buying, or even just the expectation of future buying, can cause prices and market cap to rise all out of proportion to the amount of buying that occurred. Then consider that banks will lend against collateral, which can be assets like real estate or stocks which may have this inflated perceived value created by a very small amount of relative buying pressure. And that the “money” they create with those loans can be used to buy more of the asset, which can cause prices and market cap to again rise disproportionately, which can make it easier to get more loans to buy more assets, which can make prices go up again… ad infinitum. And remember that money doesn’t actually “flow into” assets, and therefore it doesn’t need to “flow out of” assets in order for prices to drop. All it takes is a lack of people willing to buy at a certain level, for any reason at all, and the price will fall to the level someone is willing to pay as soon as a motivated seller attempts to exit their investment.\n\nUnderstand and think about the implications of that, and you’re closer to understanding the bubble/collapse cycle of asset markets than most economists and their “money flows” can ever hope to be.

Alec Watson gave me the answer in one of his latest videos: \"Algorithmic Complacency\".\n\nTLDR: Rather than read, watch, and collaborate with those I follow online, modern social media platforms like to tell me what content I should consume. Nostr, Bluesky, and Mastodon don't do this - I can see what I want and what I don't, without relying on a computer algorithm to tell me.\n\nThis got me thinking about my own use of social media platforms and my recent adoption of the Fedi-verse to circumvent the machine telling me how I should consume online content.\n\nI don't subscribe to any one platform. I've not found one that addresses all my online social needs, nor one that feature the diverse audiences I follow. Here's a rundown of what I use:\n\nYouTube - the easiest of the bunch. YT has become my new binge TV. Initially a frequented site for learning how to replace a garbage disposal or to learn some of the tricks with Davinci Resolve, YT quickly became my platform of choice for learning and entertainment content. Yes, YT has an algorithm and provides recommendations - it's how I found Technology Connections - but I like that I can use the subscriptions feed to just see content that I follow in addition to that which YT recommends.\n\nFacebook - the favorite with the old guard. TBH, I've never liked big tech owning my voice on the Internet. I'd have deleted my FB account along with X and Instagram, long ago, except that it's the one platform that my family uses. My mother uses Facebook, so do my distant cousins, but only a subset use the other platforms, and none use the Fedi-verse. FB remains as the one platform for me to post the occasional vacation photo and to find out that my cousin got married last week - and no I didn't get an invite.\n\nVero - I'm a photographer and love to post some of my more interesting art pieces online for feedback, so I can improve my craft. I used to use Instagram, until it went over to the algorithm dark side and filled my feed with short-form video. Vero maintains to be what Instagram used to be. I've not checked out Pixelfed (yet).\n\nMastodon - After Musk took over Twitter and rebranded it to X, I swiftly left and moved to Mastodon. I hate the idea of a single business entity owning my content and right to free speech online. Like many, I have my own issues with Musk and his business practices and shouldn't have to deal with them as part of my online presence.  Mastodon was and still is, the place where I get to collaborate with people I've never met in person on likeminded topics of interests. Mastodon relies on federated servers, which people own; so, there's that to consider. I've managed to find a server that caters to my interests and fulfills my desire to collaborate online.\n\nThen comes Nostr...\n\nMy friend \\_@briangreen.net introduced me to Nostr. As a long-term orange-pill advocate, I was thrilled to join Nostr to collaborate on the latest Bitcoin and Crypto news. I will say that Nostr appears less diverse in topics but that's rapidly changing as I am now seeing a lot of posts on photography, meshtastic, and other personal interests of mine. I love that Nostr is not so much a platform, but a federated protocol. I don't have to subscribe to any one app and web site to post and read content. For now, I use both Mastodon and Nostr to scratch my online collab itch. A nice thing about the Fedi-verse is that there's plenty of cross-posting apps. I use [OpenVibe](https://openvibe.social/) to post and consume content in one place. Their app is slick and works as advertised.\n\nHow do you use social media? Is Nostr your only platform, or do you still use the traditional ones?","sig":"a8db04c0760e277de1e1688d45df19d1e319844a2e2850023d6f8cc253104cfbc6a58930473bf3a67c72bd015fa2ac6f109d404ba727f7c3774432e661e38c1e"},"naddr1qqjy27r5wfsj63tcw3exzt2jv4skgttpd3kz6ctzda6hgttfwskngaeeddekgqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qygrmcpvsrj7thwac0dm25s4duj6cw0faqzf3r9670ldhwehgcfkj9vpsgqqqw4rst94nc6":{"kind":30023,"id":"4aa07c24151b63dd5936b6d5a1218cc687f6273930d688caa7e30f0b736a3999","pubkey":"7bc05901cbcbbbbb87b76aa42ade4b5873d3d009311975e7fdb7766e8c26d22b","created_at":1744208131,"tags":[["title","Extra!

My boy Ryan had, once again, drug me to a Bitcoin event in the waning days of my stubborn shitcoinery. This event was the nail in the coffin for those days, and I'm happy to say the \"stay humble stack sats\" message finally permeated. \n\nMy wife is a dedicated reseller, her family has been flipping garage sale finds and auction grabs for years, so we rarely see a flea market or antique mall that we pass up. Somewhere between Missouri and Nashville we pulled off the highway to check out a spot in a dying but (if you squint your eyes and imagine it is 50 years in the past) a picturesque little town.\n\nWe were in my little Scion FRS, a two door sports car, so when I came across an old newspaper vending machine, I had to do a lot of geometry to figure out if I could shove this thing in the Scion. I concluded that my girlfriend would have to ride in the backseat for the remaining three hour drive if I really wanted to scoop up this vending machine, because it was too wide to slide into the trunk. Even though she knew I had an infatuation for retro newspaper things and was encouraging me to buy it, I declined. Probably the right call, but I still think about that thing -- the price was right. \n\nI don't know what I would have done with it, but I have for years produced various hobbyist newspaper zines focusing on local political issues that I distributed from the coffeeshop that I worked at in my small town. The idea was hitting so hard when the social media censorship conversation was at a fever pitch after 2016 -- You can't censor a copy machine, I kept thinking. Analog zines, I was convinced, were the future.\n\nI hadn't thought through decentralized social media protocols, but I did get really tired of distributing zines that nobody was excited to pay me for. Copying, organizing, stapling. I should have known I didn't have the patience to maintain that, or the finances. \n\nEven established local news corporations, especially in my town, are struggling to justify a print version. This wasn't the case a quarter of a century ago.\n\nMy dad would stop at the Casey's convenience story every morning on the way into town, as he took us to school. If you brought your own travel mug, it was only fifty cents to fill up your cup of coffee. Nearly everyday, he would also come out with a copy of the local newspaper: The Daily Journal. The price was right around a dollar for the paper. It might have even been cheaper, like fifty or seventy-five cents. \n\nThe idea I am inching towards in this post, is that if every person valued the distribution of local (and global) news to the tune of a buck or a buck fifty, we could see the re-emergence sustaining news ecosystems. A buck fifty is almost two thousand sats today -- imagine if each appreciator of local news set aside just a thousand sats a day to zap news distributors. If there was a bias for following and amplifying local news events in each user's town, which tend to get a lot of attention on the centralized social media platforms, I think an entirely new value-4-value journalism enterprise model could emerge.\n\nIt may be important to start tinkering on a client that is built specifically for newspapers. I am not sure which features would be critical, but as the normies trickle over to the uncensorable social media protocol -- let's be ready.","sig":"085df92716adb7ae38ab4639f6ba4da9eb8c22775b37c23f62dbec0aeb380b9b5df4bf89568c567285f647a02d201bdf0a4a35344a84a104051bf4f838af1dc9"},"naddr1qqjy6mmwv4uj6ctn942x76m9de5h5ety94fx2ur4w3shg6t0dckhvupkd9kx7qgswaehxw309ahx7um5wgh8w6twv5pzp0rve5f6xtu56djkfkkg7ktr5rtfckpun95rgxaa7futy86npx8yqvzqqqr4gu2nmgjg":{"kind":30023,"id":"bd769c39767520ac938fc1d042745b6beb3b2b000de7d0729d4ea3369b12925e","pubkey":"bc6ccd13a32f94d36564dac8f5963a0d69c583c9968341bbdf278b21f53098e4","created_at":1733078447,"tags":[["title","Money as Tokenized Reputation"],["summary","Insights from the study of psychopathology"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/44a2140d37f284b2d53fb5e1c4ce95f72c5ca724c575ce199f23194bfa5f5bcc.jpg"],["t","money"],["t","finance"],["t","banking"],["t","philosophy"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","nostr"],["published_at","1733078447"],["d","Money-as-Tokenized-Reputation-vp6ilo"]],"content":"I recently listened to the Jordan B. Peterson Podcast episode titled *The Psychology of Social Status and Class* with guest Rob Henderson, and he made a point I found very compelling. The discussion wasn't about money specifically, but about the way psychopaths exploit a high-trust society.\n\nDr. Peterson said,\n\n\u003e I think the right way to think about this is that there isn't anything more valuable than reputation. Right? Because there's no difference between reputation and wealth fundamentally. I mean, even monetary wealth is a form of abstracted reputation. So yeah, you know, it's just been tokenized, essentially. Like, money is tokenization of reputation. Well, the problem is reputation can be gamed.\n\nThis is a really perceptive way to describe money, and I think there's a lot to learn by analyzing the idea. It dovetails quite well with my definition of money as a ledger of deferred consumption from my recent article *Money Is Not Wealth*. naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp0rve5f6xtu56djkfkkg7ktr5rtfckpun95rgxaa7futy86npx8yqq247t2dvet9q4tsg4qng36lxe6kc4nftayyy89kua2\n\nDeferred consumption is very closely linked to reputation. A good reputation is established by being generous, productive, helpful, and honest. Basically if you produce and contribute to other people and their wellbeing instead of only working for your own selfish interest, your reputation will benefit. That’s essentially synonymous with deferring consumption. You put in the work now, but you don’t personally benefit. You do the work for someone else’s benefit.\n\nIn the article I make the point that these pro-social behaviors, in a small community setting, accrue to you a kind of informal “credit” that defines money at its most fundamental level. You could define reputation as the sum total of those “credits” accumulated by a pattern of productive and pro-social behavior over time. The inverse is also true. Constantly asking for favors from the community, but never being willing to reciprocate that service, will cause you to accumulate a lot of unpaid “debt” to the community. We describe that as a “bad reputation”.\n\nThe ne’er-do-well loafer everyone knows who can’t hold down a job, shows no responsibility, lives off handouts and welfare, and wastes everything he gets on drinking, drugs, or gambling would be a perfect example of someone with a bad reputation. As word gets around, it isn’t long until people are hesitant to do favors for that person. They rightly view him as a malicious parasite and realize that if his behavior is rewarded, it will continue to be a drain and a detriment to the function of society.\n\nAs I pointed out, this informal “credit/reputation” system breaks down when dealing with larger groups and more complex supply chains, because it’s necessary to do one-off transactions with strangers who’s reputation you have no way of knowing and with whom you won’t have opportunity to enter into a reciprocal relationship. That’s where money comes in. Conceptualized as tokenized reputation, it represents the fact that the holder of money has provided valuable goods and services to someone else in the past in order to acquire that money. You can feel confident that engaging in a cooperative transaction with this person will be beneficial and pro-social, and not just rewarding a malicious parasite.\n\n### The Psychopathy Connection \n\nAccording to Wikipedia,\n\n\u003e  psychopathy is a mental health condition characterized by persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits.\n\nThe first characteristic given is persistent antisocial behavior. Psychopaths lack empathy and remorse, so they’re willing to use manipulation, deceit, force, or anything required to benefit themselves, regardless of the harm to others.\n\nIn the podcast I quoted, Dr. Peterson was making the point that most people are fairly good at cooperating and functioning productively in society. But a group of trusting and cooperative people makes the perfect target for a psychopath. They’ll come in, lie to everyone, take advantage of people’s goodwill, and exploit the group by any means possible until they own everything or the group sees their true character and pushes back. So they tend to be constantly moving, never staying too long because their behavior only works on unsuspecting victims, and never able to form stable long-term relationships.\n\nThe focus of the discussion was how psychopaths exploit the current victimhood culture for their own benefit by falsely portraying themselves as victims to gain special treatment they don’t deserve. But psychopaths exploit society in lots of other ways as well.\n\nPsychopaths often try to portray themselves as good and worthy people, even when they’re really the opposite. This means establishing a deceptive reputation. If money is tokenized reputation, what better way to bolster your reputation than to somehow get your hands on a lot of money? Honest, cooperative people who encounter a stranger with money will tend to assume he acquired it the same way they acquire their money; through working and providing value to others while deferring consumption to the future. They won’t hesitate to do business with that person.\n\nIf there’s a dishonest way to acquire money without actually putting in the work and providing value to others, you can bet psychopaths will sniff that out a mile away and take full advantage.\n\nUnfortunately, the game theory of money dictates that even if you know someone acquired their money through dishonest, illegal, or otherwise harmful and antisocial means, you’re still incentivized to just accept the money and do business with them anyway. Even if you know the method they used to get it is harmful to society in general, taking the money and using it yourself will benefit you personally.\n\nFor example, imagine someone came to your business and offered to buy your product, but told you they were going to pay with money they stole from a guy walking down the street last week. You might be appalled by the theft, but you would gain nothing economically by refusing to do business with the thief. You would gain economically by taking his stolen money. Doing so would just encourage him to continue stealing, which is terrible for society, but as long as he doesn’t steal from you, you’ve still benefitted financially.\n\nThis provides a strong motivation for psychopaths to continue their exploits, because if they can manage to acquire the money, they will almost certainly be able to spend that money and benefit as much as an honest person would. So in a sense, money makes it a lot easier for psychopaths to flourish, as opposed to a close-knit community that would soon catch on to their behavior and respond with punishment or expulsion from the community.\n\nI can think of a lot of people today who have a lot of money they acquired through ways that are very detrimental to society, but who maintain a veneer of public respectability almost exclusively because they do have so much money. Weapons manufacturers, career politicians, owners of exploitative and unethical businesses, and financial industry executives come to mind. Yet these people have no problem finding someone to do business with, because as the saying goes, “their money is just as green as anyone’s”.\n\n### Banking \n\nSo what if there were a way to create money with no effort? To bolster your reputation with piles of cash without having to lift a finger? You can imagine how giddy with excitement a psychopath might be at the thought.\n\nCounterfeiting seems like a possibility, but it’s actually very difficult to accomplish, and there’s a high risk of getting caught.\n\nWhat if there were a way to create “counterfeit” money that was so identical to the real thing that almost no one could tell the difference? And suppose we actually **made it legal**? Well, legal for those who have the correct license, and a crime punishable by years in prison for everyone else. Can’t have the honest people competing with you and siphoning value away from the grift, after all.\n\nThat’s essentially what we have today with the modern banking system. Banks create “money” (bank deposits) with a keystroke every time they make a loan. It costs them absolutely nothing, and they can then loan out that new money and collect interest on it, without having to lift a finger. Seems too good to be true, but in this case it is.\n\nThat subject deserves its own in-depth explanation. Suffice to say that if you’ve ever felt that the financial system is a parasitic entity infested at the highest levels by people with “persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits,” you’re probably on the right track. It’s the ideal habitat for a motivated psychopath, and I believe they’ve maneuvered themselves into the system and are busy exploiting our trust and the properties of our most crucial social technology. Unfortunately not one person in a thousand understands what’s happening. Most can see the decay spreading and feel something is wrong in society at a fundamental level, but without understanding they cause, they don’t have the knowledge or tools to fight back.\n\n\u003e It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning. \n\u003e\n\u003e \\-Henry Ford\n\nMy goal in writing is to begin building that understanding. Each person who wakes up to reality will be able to protect themselves, to stop providing sustenance to the parasites. Without access to the real wealth produced by honest, cooperative individuals, the parasites will starve. And who knows, if enough people wake up, they might be so outraged by the exploitation that they’ll start the revolution Ford dreamed about.","sig":"3cab787f334487c9f6c3e56c5d56f1a3c78fd7947529993788d70aaad1310d769511bba70253b9e6c1d6a16e481d2c5f37a3a2a7a9a6a1af3fecd3093cc40eda"},"naddr1qqk82mn509cx2tt4wpjxzar994skuepdwfjkvmr9vd6xjmmwwvkk7m3dwe5kyefdvdhkg6twvuq3vamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwwpexjmtpdshxuet5qgsph3c2q9yt8uckmgelu0yf7glruudvfluesqn7cuftjpwdynm2gygrqsqqqa28t6zfha":{"kind":30023,"id":"8b7237c925dc4b1a6874e59da6828f026f1e413238d8602f96fcd0682f0dc882","pubkey":"1bc70a0148b3f316da33fe3c89f23e3e71ac4ff998027ec712b905cd24f6a411","created_at":1744811580,"tags":[["d","untype-update-and-reflections-on-vibe-coding"],["title","Untype Update and Reflections on Vibe Coding"],["summary","A brief update and some reflections"],["image","https://i.nostr.build/NlU8uJSe1UbAvFjz.png"],["published_at","1744811580"],["t","nostr"],["t","ai"],["t","untype"]],"content":"I've been meaning to dogfood my own vibe project for a while so this feels like a good opportunity to use Untype to publish this update and reflect on my vibe coding journey. \n\n## New Untype Update\n\nAs I write this, I found it a bit annoying dealing with one of the latest features, so I'll need to make some changes right after I'm done. Nonetheless, here are some exciting developments in the Untype article composer: \n\n1. Added inline AI helper! Now you can highlight text and perform all sorts of things like fix grammar, re-write in different styles, and all sorts of other things. This is a bit annoying at the moment because it takes over the other editing functions and I need to fix the UX.\n\n2. Added pushing articles to DMs! This option, when enabled, will send the article to all the subscribers via a NIP-44 DM. (No client has implemented the subscription method yet so technically it won’t work, until one does. I may add this to nrss.app) Also, I have not tested this so it could be broken… will test eventually!\n3. Added word counts\n4. Added ability to export as markdown, export as PDF, print. \n\nThe biggest flaw I have already discovered is how \"I\" implemented the highlight functionality. Right now when you highlight some text it automatically pops up the AI helper menu and this makes for an annoying time trying to make any changes to text. I wanted to change this to show a floating clickable icon instead, but for some reason the bot is having a difficult time updating the code to this desired UX. \n\nSpeaking of difficult times, it's probably a good idea to reflect a bit upon my vibe coding journey. \n\n## Vibe Coding Nostr Projects\nFirst, I think it's important to add some context around my recent batch of nostr vibe projects. I am working on them mostly at night and occasionally on weekends in between park runs with kids, grocery shopping and just bumming around the house. People who see buggy code or less than desired UX should understand that I am not spending days coding this stuff. Some apps are literally as simple as typing one prompt! \n\nThat said, its pretty clear by now that one prompt cannot produce a highly polished product. This is why I decided to limit my number of project to a handful that I really wish existed, and slowly update them over time - fixing bugs, adding new features in hopes of making them the best tools - not only on nostr but the internet in general. As you can imagine this is not a small task, especially for sporadic vibe coding. \n\n### Fighting the bot\n\nOne of my biggest challenges so far besides having very limited time is getting the bot to do what I want it to do. I guess if you've done any vibe coding at all you're probably familiar with what I'm trying to say. You prompt one thing and get a hallucinated response, or worse, a complete mess out the other end that undoes most of the progress you've made. Once the initial thing is created, which barely took any time, now you're faced with making it work a certain way. This is where the challenges arise. \n\nHere's a brief list of issues I've faced when vibe-coding with various tools: \n\n**1. Runaway expenses** - tools like Cline tend to do a better job directly in VSCode, but they can also add up dramatically. Before leaning into v0 (which is where I do most of my vibe coding now), I would often melt through $10 credit purchases faster than I could get a decent feature out. It was not uncommon for me to spend $20-30 on a weekend just trying to debug a handful of issues. Naturally, I did not wish to pay these fees so I searched for alternatives. \n\n**2. File duplication** - occasionally, seemingly out of nowhere, the bot will duplicate files by creating an entire new copy and attached \"-fixed\" to the file name. Clearly, I'm not asking for duplicate files, I just want it to fix the existing file, but it does happen and it's super annoying. Then you are left telling it which version to keep and which one to delete, and sometimes you have to be very precise or it'll delete the wrong thing and you have to roll back to a previous working version. \n\n**3. Code duplication** - similar to file duplication, occasionally the bot will duplicate code and do things in the most unintuitive way imaginable. This often results in loops and crashes that can take many refreshes just to revert back to a working state, and many more prompts to avoid the duplication entirely - something a seasoned dev never has to deal with (or so I imagine). \n\n**4. Misinterpreting your request** - occasionally the bot will do something you didn't ask for because it took your request quite literally. This tends to happen when I give it very specific prompts that are targeted at fixing one very specific thing. I've noticed the bots tend to do better with vague asks - hence a pretty good result on the initial prompt. \n\n**5. Doing things inefficiently, without considering smarter approaches** - this one is the most painful of vibe coding issues. As a person who may not be familiar with some of the smarter ways of handling development, you rely on the bot to do the right thing. But, when the bot does something horribly inefficiently and you are non-the-wiser, it can be tough to diagnose the issue. I often fight myself asking the bot \"is this really the best way to handle things? Can't we ... / shouldn't we .../ isn't this supposed to...\" etc. I guess one of the nice side effects of this annoyance is being able to prompt better. I learn that I should ask the bot to reflect on its own code more often and seek ways to do things more simply. \n\n**A combination of the above, or total chaos** - this is a category where all hell breaks loose and you're trying to put out one fire after another. Fix one bug, only to see 10 more pop up. Fix those, to see 10 more and so on. I guess this may sound like typical development, but the bot amplifies issues by acting totally irrationally. This is typically when I will revert to a previous save point and just undo everything, often losing a lot of progress. \n\n## Lessons Learned\nIf I had to give my earlier self some tips on how to be a smarter vibe coder, here's how I'd summarize them:\n\n1. **Fork often** - in v0 I now fork for any new major feature I'd like to add (such as the AI assistant). \n\n2. **Use targeting tools** - in v0 you can select elements and describe how you wish to edit them. \n\n3. **Refactor often** - keeping the code more manageable speeds up the process. Since the bot will go through the entire file, even if it only makes one small change, it's best to keep the files small and refactoring achieves that. \n\nI guess the biggest lesson someone might point out is just to stop vibe coding. It may be easier to learn proper development and do things right. For me it has been a spare time hobby (one that I will admit is taking more of my extra time than I'd like). I don't really have the time to learn proper development. I feel like I've learned a lot just bossing the bot around and have learned a bunch of things in the process. That's not to say that I never will, but for the moment being my heart is still mostly in design. I haven't shared much of anything I have designed recently - mostly so I can remain speaking more freely without it rubbing off on my work. \n\nI'll go ahead and try to publish this to see if it actually works 😂. Here goes nothing... (oh, I guess I could use the latest feature to export as markdown so I don't lose any progress! Yay!\n","sig":"6379821131bf160c04ec37da277df1f0e4e613193ca6a3cface31017cc18492da0f6ddada85d65e7fec3d82995b5efcce7aef90fbe1ce49ec7ee02de916e7a97"},"naddr1qql4g6r994pxjarrda5kuer0d3kxzu3dg3jkyct5v5k5xctw94yxzuny94skuepd2dhkvapdf4hkuete94pk7etcd9ehgttnvdsk2errqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyrgkvu5n6ha3s8qsljjdtwur8fwjzsjg4r38e0u5m66ej5pc3ecqgqcyqqq823cs3q2my":{"kind":30023,"id":"3401382b83af32f13683fd7e20f1d622c7b798643ca7c77a340311b05a91ece9","pubkey":"d1667293d5fb181c10fca4d5bb833a5d214248a8e27cbf94deb59950388e7004","created_at":1745942419,"tags":[["title","The Bitcoindollar Debate: Can Hard and Soft Money Coexist?"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/331211c6df3a03e4ab8b0bc322895877694a238f4115f190e98e0429b6299d7a.jpg"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","stablecoin"],["t","nostr"],["t","geopolitics"],["t","economics"],["t","finance"],["t","bitcoindollar"],["published_at","1745942419"],["d","The-Bitcoindollar-Debate-Can-Hard-and-Soft-Money-Coexist-scaedc"]],"content":"The [\"Bitcoindollar\" system](https://www.bitcoindollar.net/)—an emerging term which describes the interplay of U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins and Bitcoin as complementary forces in the evolving monetary framework of the digital era (and which replaces the defunct Petrodollar system)—has sparked an interesting debate on Nostr with PowMaxi. \n\nYou will find the thread links at the bottom of this article. \n\nPowmaxi argues that attempting to merge hard money (Bitcoin) with soft money (the U.S. dollar) is structurally doomed, because the systems are inherently contradictory and cannot coexist without one eventually destroying the other.\n\nThis critique is certainly valid, but ONLY if the Bitcoindollar is viewed as a final system. But I never claim that. To the contrary, the conclusion in my book is that this is a system that buys time for fiat, absorbs global demand for monetary stability, and ushers in a Bitcoinized world without the immediate collapse and the reset of the fiat system which would otherwise cause dramatic consequences. The Bitcoindollar is the only way to a gradual Bitcoin dominance in 10-20 years time while avoiding sudden collapse of the fiat system, so that also the power elites who hold the keys to this system can adapt.\\\nAt least this is my hope. \n\nTherefore the \"fusion\" isn't the future. The siphoning is. And the U.S. may try to ride it as long as possible. The Bitcoindollar system is a transitional strategic framework, not a\\\npermanent monetary equilibrium. In the end I agree with PowMaxi.\n\nHis detailed critique deserves an equally detailed analysis. Here's how the objections break down and why they don’t necessarily undermine the Bitcoindollar system.\n\n### 1. Hard Money vs. Soft Money: Opposed Systems?\n\n**Objection:** Bitcoin is a closed, decentralized system with a fixed supply; the dollar is an open, elastic system governed by central banks and political power. These traits are mutually exclusive and incompatible.\n\n**Response:** Ideologically, yes. Practically, no. Hybrid financial systems are not uncommon. Bitcoin and stablecoins serve different user needs: Bitcoin is a store of value; stablecoins are mediums of exchange. Their coexistence mirrors real-world economic needs. The contradiction can be managed, and is not fatal at least for the transitional phase.\n\n### 2. Scarcity vs. Elasticity: Economic Incompatibility?\n\n**Objection:** Bitcoin can’t inject liquidity in crises; fiat systems can. Anchoring fiat to Bitcoin removes policymakers' tools.\n\n**Response:** Correct — but that’s *why Bitcoin is held as a reserve*, not used as the primary medium of exchange in the Bitcoindollar model. Fiat-based liquidity mechanisms still function via stablecoins, while Bitcoin acts as a **counterweight to long-term monetary debasement**. The **system’s strength is in its optionality**: you don’t have to use Bitcoin until you *want* an exit ramp from fiat.\n\n### 3. No Stable Equilibrium: One Must Win?\n\n**Objection:** The system will destabilize. Either Bitcoin undermines fiat or fiat suppresses Bitcoin.\n\n**Response:** Not necessarily in this transitional phase. **The “conflict” isn’t between tools — it’s between control philosophies**. The dollar won’t disappear overnight, and Bitcoin isn’t going away. The likely outcome is a **gradual shifting of savings and settlement layers to Bitcoin**, while fiat continues to dominate day-to-day payments and credit markets — until Bitcoin becomes structurally better in both.\n\n### 4. Gresham’s and Thiers’ Law: Hollowing Fiat?\n\n**Objection:** People save in Bitcoin and spend fiat, eroding fiat value.\n\n**Response:** Yes — and that’s *been happening since 2009*. But this isn’t a flaw; it’s a **transition mechanism**. The Bitcoindollar model recognizes this and creates a bridge: it monetizes U.S. debt while preserving access to hard money. In the long run, **my expectation is that naturally bitcoin will prevail both as a SOV and currency**, but until then, stablecoins and T-bill-backed tokens serve useful roles in the global economy.\n\n### 5. Philosophical Incompatibility?\n\n**Objection:** Bitcoin prioritizes individual sovereignty; fiat systems are hierarchical. They can't be reconciled.\n\n**Response:** They don’t need to be reconciled ideologically to function in parallel. Users choose the tool that suits their needs. One empowers individual autonomy; the other offers state-backed convenience. This is a competition of values, not a mechanical incompatibility. **The Bitcoindollar model is a strategy**. It’s **a bridge between old and new systems**, not a permanent coexistence.\n\n### 6. Fusion is Impossible?\n\n**Objection:** It’s only a temporary bridge. One side must lose.\n\n**Response:** Exactly. The Bitcoindollar system *is* a transitional bridge. But that doesn’t reduce its value. It provides a functional pathway for individuals, companies, and governments to gradually exit broken monetary systems and experiment with new models.\n\nIn the meantime, the U.S. benefits from stablecoin-driven Treasury demand, while Bitcoin continues to grow as a global reserve asset.\n\n### Bottom line: A Strategic Convergence, Not a Permanent Fusion\n\n**The Bitcoindollar system isn’t a contradiction. It’s a convergence zone.** It reflects the reality that **monetary systems evolve gradually**, not cleanly. Bitcoin and fiat will compete, overlap, and influence each other. **Eventually, yes — hard money wins. But until then, hybrid systems offer powerful stepping stones.**\n\n**Thread links:**\n\nThread started [from this initial post](https://primal.net/e/nevent1qqsza9ns7qlcrf93mp78dr5ck0dd9lm8kz9kcjwf7l48v8emndu485qpas40p).\n\n[Thread Powmaxi](https://primal.net/e/nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzqr6l7jnm9dlrcpj4ecthe584ngsdvn86g4936ug7prh8h52xa4n9qqsf7kmjfy6ak9f73nfr4splfy08x7wgu7mn088glsauyq57kjhk4wcmy58he)\n\n[PowMaxi profile](https://primal.net/p/nprofile1qqsq7hl557et0c7qv4wwza7dpav6yrtye7j9fvwhz8sgaeaaz3hdvegh7srg6)","sig":"e4782857c8dd09d9ecac2886f8801a69282757eea8c5aaf8239e9f30e1b5739e34d13ea8a2bf9b17c9ab7129d4d61ff874a75923157da83faed22066d326ecb0"},"naddr1qqm5y6t5vdhkjm3dge5kcm2xv4ehgtfjxqer2t2hdpjhyefdgd5kuetdvyk56et9w3ej63njv4jkgmmd945hwwtgv4esz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzpcc7snz27m4g25pkugdzx4z4nwjcejl9mkc3r97r3yxs5pmmh27qqvzqqqr4gu29qpuh":{"kind":30023,"id":"e89af1e32c5dd720847ba3dc44e8db974626b54049542a32faf867c3f3c6d4d1","pubkey":"e31e84c4af6ea855036e21a2354559ba58ccbe5ddb11197c3890d0a077bbabc0","created_at":1744113237,"tags":[["image","https://blossom.primal.net/78b5dc70dfcebb5c17e12dac45c5d32c283188bd5c1330ae40095f4ba0d8a0a6.png"],["title","Bitcoin FilmFest 2025: Where Cinema Meets Freedom."],["t","film"],["t","festival"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","nostr"],["t","community"],["published_at","1744113237"],["d","Bitcoin-FilmFest-2025-Where-Cinema-Meets-Freedom-iw9hes"]],"content":"The third annual edition of Bitcoin FilmFest returns to Warsaw this May.

While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time. Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms. Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.*\n--Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin Talk-- August 5, 2010\n\nI very be coded  some HTML buttons using Claude and uploaded it to https://github.com/GhostZaps/ It's just a button that links to zapper.fun.\n\n\nI signed up for Substack to build an email address, but learned adding different payment options to Substack is against their terms and services. Since I write about nostr, these terms seem as silly as someone saying Craig Wright is Satoshi. It's easy to build an audience on Substack however, or so I thought. Why is it easier to build an audience on Subtack though? Because Substack is a platform that markets to writers. Anyone with a ~~pen~~ ~~keyboard~~ smartphone and an email can create an account with Substack. There's just one problem: You are an Internet serf, working the land for your Internet landlord--The Duke of Substack.\n\n\nThen I saw that [Shawn posted about Substack's UX](nostr:nevent1qqstgux34dfp8c34t4krymmygu7jnjsqm6spk7a89nffkxq84rpr20gt96uaf). \n\n![Shawn Post](https://gitea.marc26z.com/marc/Marc26z/raw/commit/e65733bda9b6cf42083cb9c9d4e51ff8118c5850/publicSpech1.png)\n\nI should have grabbed my reading glasses before pushing the post button, but it occurred to me that I could use Ghost to do this and there is probably a way to hack it to accept bitcoin payments over the lightning network and host it yourself. So I spun my noddle, doodled some plans...And then it hit me. Ghost allows for markdown and HTML. I learned HTML and CSS with free-code camp, but ain't nobody got time to type CSS so I vibe-coded a button that ~~baits~~ sends the clicker to my zapper.fun page. This can be used on any blog that allows you to paste html into it so I added it to my Ghost blog self-hosted on a Start 9. The blog is on TOR at http://p66dxywd2xpyyrdfxwilqcxmchmfw2ixmn2vm74q3atf22du7qmkihyd.onion/, but most people around me have been conditioned to fear the dark web so I used the [cloudflared](https://github.com/remcoros/cloudflared-startos) to host my newsletter on the clear net at https://marc26z.com/ \n\n## Integrating Nostr Into My Self-Hosted Ghost Newsletter\n\nI would venture to say I am more technical than the average person and I know HTML, but my CSS is fuzzy. I also know how to print(\"Hello world!\") in python, but I an NPC beyond the basics. Nevertheless, I found that I know enough to make a button. I can't code well enough to create my own nostr long-form client and create plugins for ghost that send lightning payments to lighting channel, but I know enough about nostr to know that I don't need to. That's why nostr is so F@#%-ing cool! It's all connected.\n**\n- One button takes you to zapper.fun  where you can zap anywhere between 1 and ,000,000 sats.**\n- Another button sends you to a zap planner pre-set to send 5,000 sats to the author per month using nostr.\n- Yet another button sends you to a zap planner preset to send 2,500 sats per month.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. I entered a link that takes the clicker to my [Shopstr Merch Store](nostr:npub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0). The point is to write as self-sovereign as possible. I might need to change my lightning address when stuff breaks every now and then, but I like the idea of busking for sats by writing on the Internet using the Value 4 Value model. I dislike ads, but I also want people to buy stuff from people I do business with because I want to promote using bitcoin as peer-to-peer electronic cash, not NGU porn. I'm not prude. I enjoy looking at the price displayed on my BlockClock micro every now and then, but I am not an NGU porn addict.\n\nThis line made this pattern, that line made this pattern. All that Bolinger Bart Simpson bullshit has nothing to with bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It is the musings of a population trapped in the fiat mind-set. Bitcoin is permissionless so I realized I was bieng a hipocryte by using a permissioned payment system becaue it was easier than writing a little vibe code. I don't need permission to write for sats. I don't need to give my bank account number to Substack. I don't need to pay a 10$ vig to publish on a  a platform which is not designed for stacking sats. I can write on Ghost and integrate clients that already exist in the multi-nostr-verse.\n\n### Nostr Payment Buttons\n\nThe buttons can be fouund at https://github.com/Marc26z/GhostZapButton\n\nYou can use them yourself. Just replace my npub with your npub or add any other link you want. It doesn't technically need to be a nostr link. It can be anything. I have a link to another Ghost article with other buttons that lead down different sat pledging amounts. It's early. Everyone who spends bitcoin is on nostr and nostr is small, but growing community. I want to be part of this community. I want to find other writers on nostr and stay away from Substack. \n\n\u003cstyle\u003e\n  .zap-button {\n    background: linear-gradient(to right, orange, purple);\n    color: white;\n    padding: 10px 20px;\n    border: 2px solid purple;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    display: block;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n  }\n\u003c/style\u003e\n\u003c!--change \"npub1marc26z8nh...\" to your npub  --\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://marc26z.com/support-my-work-by-subscribing-5-000-sats-per-month/\"\u003e\n  \u003cbutton class=\"zap-button\"\u003eSupport By Pledging 5,000 Sats Per Month\u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\n\nHere's what it looks like on Ghost: https://marc26z.com/zaps-on-ghost/\n\nnpub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0","sig":"66231301392312cbfd9d65396be29a02577633bbbaa7681d7f7a10ad65434d97b966cc6c6672f42596ee677dcf9bc5dc1a89d91259fd3603f14e8564ac6cf464"},"naddr1qqnyy6t5vdhkjm3df9hxsetjd96xzmnrv5khw6t5dqk5y6t5ddjhjtf3dfcnvdrjqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyrhxqv5rl67ycvdsnypnjfqg5tllrkhkntpzgjj7ftg8aj3mc7w7cqcyqqq823cmm2pwz":{"kind":30023,"id":"d3a03f75ba9a77b49b4bf2e12c9321338f916e5ad3339915432aa2e514c3da41","pubkey":"ee603283febc4c31b09903392408a2fff1daf69ac2244a5e4ad07eca3bc79dec","created_at":1740613816,"tags":[["title","Bitcoin Inheritance with Bitkey"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/ae702be0b2713a35a6eb02adf5df0b4de39ecd0240e488ee9057287dc0d8c877.png"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","nostr"],["t","inheritence"],["published_at","1740613816"],["t","devs"],["d","Bitcoin-Inheritance-with-Bitkey-1jq64r"]],"content":"Source Article by the Bitkey team and Undine Rubeze: https://bitkey.build/inheritance-is-live-heres-how-it-works/ \n\nTLDR: You wrap your mobile key, and encrypted this wrapped key with your beneficiaries public key.

Esto no es un sueño lejano, ¡es la realidad que está tomando forma gracias a Nostr! Este protocolo **descentralizado**, nacido en 2020 de la mente ingeniosa de un desarrollador brasileño conocido como *fiatjaf*, ha surgido como una respuesta vibrante a los desafíos del internet actual. En un mundo donde las redes sociales centralizadas han comenzado a tambalearse bajo el peso de la **censura**, la privacidad comprometida y el control excesivo, Nostr llega como un soplo de aire fresco, prometiendo devolvernos el poder sobre nuestra voz y nuestros datos.\n\n\n## Cómo surge Nostr \nEl nacimiento de Nostr no fue un accidente, sino una reacción a un panorama digital que pedía a gritos un cambio. Hacia finales de la década de 2010, plataformas como **Twitter** enfrentaban crecientes críticas por sus políticas de **moderación**, dejando a muchos usuarios frustrados y silenciados. Al mismo tiempo, alternativas como **Mastodon** o **ActivityPub**, aunque descentralizadas, no terminaban de cuajar para todos debido a su complejidad técnica o diferencias culturales. Fue en este caldo de cultivo donde *fiatjaf*, inspirado por la resistencia de **Bitcoin** y su criptografía de clave pública, lanzó **Nostr** en noviembre de 2020. Pero el verdadero punto de inflexión llegó en diciembre de 2022, cuando *Jack Dorsey*, cofundador de Twitter, donó 14 bitcoins (unos 250,000 dólares) al proyecto. ¡Ese fue el momento en que Nostr pasó de ser un secreto de la comunidad *web3* a brillar en el radar global!\n\n\n## Una evolución que no para de sorprendernos\nDesde sus humildes comienzos, Nostr ha crecido a pasos agigantados. Su diseño es simple pero poderoso: \"*Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays*\" (Notas y otras cosas transmitidas por relevadores) usa servidores ligeros llamados *relays* para distribuir mensajes firmados criptográficamente por los usuarios. ¿Lo mejor? No depende de un servidor central, lo que lo hace prácticamente ++imposible de censurar++. En sus primeros años, era un terreno experimental, con aplicaciones como **Damus** (un cliente tipo Twitter) abriendo camino. Hoy, en 2025, la escena es vibrante: desde **Primal 2.0**, con búsquedas avanzadas y feeds personalizados, hasta integraciones con la **Lightning Network** de Bitcoin, que permite \"**zaps**\" (*micropagos*) para apoyar a creadores. Los desarrolladores no paran de innovar, creando desde marketplaces descentralizados hasta sistemas de identidad, demostrando que Nostr es mucho más que una red social: ¡es una base para reinventar el internet!\n\n\n## La importancia de Nostr hoy y mañana\n¿Por qué Nostr importa tanto ahora? Porque está devolviendo la *soberanía* a los usuarios en un momento en que la *privacidad* y la *libertad* en línea están bajo asedio. Con cada relay que se suma y cada cliente que aparece, Nostr construye una red resistente donde las grandes tecnológicas no dictan las reglas. Su integración con Bitcoin está creando una economía circular emocionante: imagina ganar *sats* (fracciones de bitcoin) por tus publicaciones o apoyar directamente a tus creadores favoritos sin intermediarios. En febrero de 2025, ya vemos comunidades activas, desde entusiastas de la tecnología hasta artistas, floreciendo en este ecosistema abierto.\n\nDe cara al futuro, Nostr tiene el potencial de ser un pilar del internet que siempre quisimos: descentralizado, transparente y al servicio de las personas. No solo compite con las redes sociales tradicionales, sino que las supera al ofrecer un lienzo en blanco para que cualquiera construya lo que imagine, desde plataformas de comunicación hasta soluciones IoT o mercados globales. Su simplicidad invita a miles de desarrolladores a sumarse, y su resistencia a la censura asegura que las voces marginadas siempre tengan un lugar. Si **Bitcoin** nos dio libertad financiera, **Nostr** nos está dando libertad digital, y juntos podrían ser la dupla que transforme cómo interactuamos en línea.\n[[]()]()\n\n## Un gran futuro nos espera\nNostr no es solo un protocolo; es un movimiento, una chispa de optimismo en un mundo digital que a veces parece gris. Cada vez que alguien se une, configura un relay o prueba una nueva app, estamos dando un paso hacia un internet más justo y emocionante. Así que, ¿qué esperas? Nostr no es el futuro lejano, ¡es el presente vibrante que está creciendo hoy! **Únete**, experimenta y sé parte de esta revolución que está poniendo el poder de internet de vuelta en nuestras manos. ¡El mañana digital nunca lució tan prometedor!\n","sig":"372b9df72c1c31b6add1236f851415180ac07a19520bb172860de856dbf61e33b18163726a336ac2a8e48ba1de0e0613cc352bb5c519ac573f55a8c2919523fc"},"naddr1qqqqz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzqhc836gvaauxlg9vwafps2gv298rxvf7q7f4qlk32d6ucket4j4rqvzqqqr4gul6naf7":{"kind":30023,"id":"7ee41426033f3979ebe992842baa4dcad44e74e5ee625b5ce543e54cde9d4f37","pubkey":"5f078e90cef786fa0ac775218290c514e33313e0793507ed15375cc5b2bacaa3","created_at":1745664699,"tags":[["title","Panda story 1"],["summary","Initially posted on Hive, story is between 300 and 500 characters.

Every action you take is signed by this private key, validating that was you that generated that event, whether it be a note, a like, a list, or whatever else. Like a broken record, I have to state that it is irreplaceable. YOU own your identity and no one else. It is your responsibility to keep your nsec safe, but of course, you also want to be able to use all the different apps and clients available. To aid you in this process, a few different tools have been developed. Let's take a look at some that are more common and easy-to-use, where to use them, and for what.\n\n### The Browser Extension\nThis is probably the simplest and most straight forward form of private key manager available. There are many options to choose from, each compatible with various, commonly used browsers, including mobile browsers. Many provide the option to manage multiple keys for different profiles. Some are simply a signer while others may include other features. The concept is very simple. The extension holds your key and exposes it only only enough to sign an event. These extensions can be set to different levels of manual approval that you can control based on the level of convenience you seek. The ease and convenience does trade off a bit of security, as your private key will be exposed momentarily each time you create an event. It is up to you to choose whether this is appropriate for your use. For casual browsing and social media use, it is a fairly good and easy to use option. Nearly all Nostr apps and clients support signing with this method.\n\n### The Remote Signer\nOften referred as a \"bunker\", Nostr remote signers hold your private key completely offline and communicating with clients. Clients send events to the signer to be signed, which then sends back the signed event for publishing. This bunker can be hosted on your own hardware or managed by a truested 3rd party. As long as the signer is online, it can communicate as needed. The signer generates a \"bunker string\" that is used to communicate. These may seem cumbersome to set up, as each client that you intend to use will need its own permissions. Once all of the pieces and permissions are in place, most of this activity will happen in the background. Bunkers allow for a lot of flexibility. The \"bunker string\" for a single app can be shared with other users who you may want to be able to make posts on your behalf. Multiple people can manage a social media profile, while the main owner of that identity maintains control of the nsec. These bunker strings can be revoked and replaced at any time. This signing method is growing in popularity and many clients already offer support for it.\n\n### The Native Android Signer\nCurrently, Amber is the only native app available to handle Nostr event signing. It is an incredible tool for managing your Nostr key on your mobile device. The signing flow is similar to remote signing, as described above, but it can communicate with both your Android native Nostr apps and web clients accessed through most mobile browsers, eliminating the need for a browser extension. Similar apps are under development for iOS, but I don't use any of those devices, so covering that here will only happen via other's opinions at a later date. Check [this list](nostr:198da20e476b857d6a928d8fa4996af3f883e6573f9e7d5e5f85761f4f23b5cc) for current options.\n\n### NcryptSec\nNcryptSec signing works by encrypting your nsec on a local device, unlocked by a password that you choose. Support for this method is very limited, as the encrypted private key stays on your device. If you intend to use Nostr through one device and few apps, this can be a very secure option, as long as you can remember your password, as it cannot be changed.\n\n### NFC and Hardware Signers\nSome devices have been developed to store your nsec completely offline on a device or NFC chip, and some clients have added support for scanning/connecting to sign. I haven't personally tried any of these options, nor do I intend to promote the sale of any particular products. If you are interested in these techniques and devices, the information is not hard to find. The price of a devices varies, depending on your feature needs.\n\nThere are also DIY options that utilize existing hardware, if you are into that sort of thing.\n\n### Higher Security and Recoverability Options\nCreating a scheme that allows for recovery of a lost key while maintaining the integrity of a unique identity is no easy task. The key must be fractured into shards, encrypted, and distributed across multiple servers in various locations, while you maintain a portion or portions of your own.

And with all the information available at our fingertips, the overwhelming majority still haven't educated themselves on the function of the banking system. That's a tragedy, given the significant role banking plays in the modern economy, and the corruption at the very base of the industry.\n\nBanking is built on a lie. It's a big lie. Not in the sense of how false it is, but in the sense of the harm caused. It's more of a “weasel words” type of lie, a lie of omission and misdirection, the kind of lie a sleazy lawyer would use to get a guilty client off the hook. My goal is to explain, as clearly as possible, how the modern banking system works. Why you should care will be a topic for another day.\n\nI want to start off with a big thank you to whoever created the website \u003chttps://banklies.org/\u003e. If you aren't familiar with this gem, bookmark it now. There's no better place on the internet to get detailed documentation on this particular subject. Everyone should spend an afternoon reading and listening to the information there. You'll never be able to see the world the same way if you absorb it and understand the implications.\n\n### Where Does Money Come From? \n\nThere's been a lot of talk since the COVID “pandemic” and associated QE deluge about the Fed and their money printing. Most people have some awareness that “the Fed prints money and that causes inflation.” There's some truth to that idea, but it also misses the real story. Most people don't understand that when someone says “money printing,” the correct response is “which kind of money?”\n\nBanks operate by calling two different things “money,” and hoping everyone treats them the same. The average person might say “I have $100 in my wallet” or “I have $100 in my bank account” without realizing they aren't talking about the same thing at all. They might take the $100 in their wallet and “put it in the bank” without realizing that as soon as they do, that $100 becomes something else entirely.\n\nThe $100 bill in your wallet has the words “Federal Reserve Note” printed on it. This is one form of what's known as “base money.” Base money exists in two forms, cash and bank reserves. You can think of bank reserves as electronic cash that only banks can use.\n\nBase money is created by the Federal Reserve. Creating base money is what the Fed does when they “print money.” They create bank reserves electronically by putting the numbers in the ledger at the Fed. The cash is printed by the Treasury, but that's just a technicality, it's printed at the request of the Fed.\n\nThe current circulating supply of cash is $2.3 trillion, and bank reserves are about $3.5 trillion. However, if you look at the total amount of US dollars, including money in people’s bank accounts, it’s currently $20.8 trillion dollars. So if base money is $5.8 trillion in total, what is the other $15 trillion? Well, it’s largely made up of bank deposits. So where do bank deposits come from? It can’t be cash people deposit into their accounts, like you might expect from the name, since cash only totals $2.3 trillion and bank deposits are over 6 times larger. The answer is that banks create them.\n\nSo as you can see, the largest category of dollars aren’t “printed” by the Fed, they’re created by the banks. And the way banks create dollars is so simple, it almost doesn’t seem real. Banks create money by making loans.\n\nThis seems completely counterintuitive to the way most people imagine banks work. That’s understandable, since the way banks work has almost no relation to the way individuals handle their own finances. You might make a loan to someone. Your friend asks to borrow $20 at the restaurant since he forgot his wallet at home. You pull yours out and hand him a $20 bill. In order to make that loan, you had to go to work, accomplish something, get paid, and save that $20 in your wallet. You couldn’t spend the $20, and you can’t spend it now until your friend pays back the loan. Obviously no new money was created to make that loan, work was done and money was saved and then given to the borrower so he can spend it instead of the lender.\n\nMost people assume banks work the same way. They assume that when they deposit some money at the bank, the bank stores that money in a vault somewhere with their name on it. And they assume that when banks make loans, they take some money from a big pile of money stored in a vault somewhere and give it to the borrower. But that isn’t how it works at all.\n\nWhen someone goes to the bank for a loan, the bank doesn’t draw on some pile of cash they have saved up somewhere. Instead, they use a simple accounting trick. They create a bank account for the borrower, and they type the amount of the loan into the borrower’s account balance. It’s really that simple. That balance becomes a “bank deposit.” Even though that money was never deposited in the bank, and in fact didn’t exist at all until the bank typed those numbers into the computer, it’s still called the same thing as the money you deposit into the bank when you get your paycheck.\n\nSo what is a bank deposit? It’s really a promise by the bank to give the account holder money. If you have $100 in your bank account, you expect to be able to go to the bank and withdraw that $100 in cash from your account and put it in your pocket. Remember, that $100 bill is base money, something completely different from the bank deposit in your savings or checking account. The implicit promise by banks is that any money in your bank account, any bank deposit, is as good as cash and can be exchanged for cash at any moment.\n\nBut of course that must be a lie, since there are $15 trillion of bank deposits and only $2.3 trillion dollars of cash. That means if everyone in the US went to the bank tomorrow and tried to withdraw their money in cash, the banks would run out of cash while still owing $12.7 trillion dollars to depositors. It’s actually much worse than that, since a lot of the cash is already in peoples’ pockets, much of it circulating in foreign countries outside the US. Banks only hold around $100 billion in their vaults on any given day. So if everyone tried to withdraw their money from their bank accounts, which banks have implicitly promised they can do, each person could get around $0.007 of every dollar on deposit. That’s less than one cent of every dollar. So the promise banks are built on, the promise to give you the money in your account, turns out to be at least 99% a lie.\n\nSo how can it continue like this? How do banks keep operating with so little cash and so many promises to give cash? Why does anyone put money in the bank when they keep less than a penny of every dollar you deposit available to withdraw when you need it? The answer is, banks don’t tell you that. And if nobody knows, people won’t all come asking for their money one day. If they did, all the banks would fail instantly. So they do anything in their power to keep that from happening.\n\n### How Do Bank Deposits Work? \n\nThe reason most people never question the function of their bank, is that banks do everything possible to make their dishonest “bank deposits” function the same as cash, and actually better than cash in a lot of ways. Instead of having to withdraw cash from your bank and give it to someone, you can just exchange bank deposits. You can do this in a lot of super convenient ways, like writing a check or using a debit card, or more recently even right from your smartphone with an app like Venmo or CashApp. This is very convenient for the customer, and even more convenient for the bank. When you pay someone else using your bank deposit, all they have to do is lower the number in your account and raise the number in the other person’s account by the amount of the transaction. Quick, easy and convenient for everyone involved.\n\nAnd if you happen to be paying someone who doesn’t have an account at your bank, that’s no problem either. Your bank will just pay the other person’s bank, and they can then change the number in the other person’s account. Now of course banks want real money for their transactions, not the fake bank deposits the commoners use. Remember the bank reserves I mentioned earlier that are like cash for banks only? Well that’s how banks settle transactions between themselves. All banks have an account at the Fed, and the Fed settles up between banks by changing the number of bank reserves in their respective accounts at the Fed. In essence, the Fed is just a bank for banks, another entity that works just like your local bank, but only holds accounts with banks and governments and not with ordinary people.\n\nThis convenience discourages people from withdrawing cash from their bank, since it’s actually easier to use the bank deposits than the cash. Besides that, banks use a lot of arbitrary policies to make it difficult for people to withdraw cash, even if they want to. If you didn’t know that, you’ve probably never tried to take $5,000 in cash out of your bank account. If you do, you’ll probably be asked some irrelevant questions about what you plan to do with the money. That’s if they let you withdraw it at all. Ask for $20,000 and you’ll almost certainly have to schedule an appointment to withdraw it in a few days, after the next cash delivery comes in. Most community bank branches only keep around $75,000 in cash on hand at any given time, so you can see how few withdrawals it would take to completely drain their vault.\n\nBut increasingly now, the biggest threat to banks isn’t from people withdrawing cash, it’s from people withdrawing to a different bank. Remember, banks have to settle with each other at the end of the day. And since they won’t accept each other’s sketchy “bank deposits” in payment, they have to settle by transferring balances between their respective reserve balances at the Fed. As you can see, banks have loaned into existence $11.5 trillion more in bank deposits than they hold in bank reserves, so it doesn’t take much withdrawal from one bank to drain their reserve balance to zero and cause the bank to fail. Bank runs have been a recurring problem ever since the entire dishonest fractional reserve banking system began, and even in 2023 a few US banks suffered bank runs and collapsed in some of the biggest bank failures in history.\n\n### Why Banking is Legalized Theft \n\nNow that we’ve explained on the most basic level how banks work, let’s briefly explore a few basic implications.\n\nWe’ve established that banks create money when they make a loan. How easy would your life be if you could create money at no cost and loan it to people? Is it any wonder that the financial industry is full of extremely wealthy individuals?\n\nLet’s think through for a second why I would categorize what banks do as theft. First off, you need to understand what money is, and more importantly what it is not. I lay out some fundamental principles in this article.\n\nnaddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp0rve5f6xtu56djkfkkg7ktr5rtfckpun95rgxaa7futy86npx8yqq247t2dvet9q4tsg4qng36lxe6kc4nftayyy89kua2\n\nSummarized in one sentence, money is a ledger of productive effort with deferred consumption. It represents work someone did for another person, instead of for their own benefit. In a sense, it’s an abstract representation of, or a claim on, the wealth in a society. Having money indicates that you provided value to someone else in the past, and therefore deserve to receive value from someone in the future if you choose to exercise that claim.\n\nAnyone who has money can loan that money to someone. This is a transfer of your claim on wealth to that person. They can then use the money to buy something, and benefit from that loan. But with that type of loan, there is always a tradeoff. The tradeoff is what’s called opportunity cost. While you have the money, you have the option to exercise that claim at any time and buy something you want. If you loan the money to someone, you incur the cost of giving up that option for as long as it takes until the loan is repaid. You already put in the effort to create the wealth that money represents, now you’re sacrificing your opportunity to benefit from that effort by buying something you want.\n\nBank loans are different. There is no opportunity cost. The bank doesn’t have the money to begin with, because they haven’t put in any effort or created anything of value to deserve it. They just create the money out of thin air. There is no sacrifice on the part of the bank to make that loan possible. They don’t have to forego spending any money to make the loan because the money didn’t exist in the first place.\n\nSo when the bank creates money, they’re creating new claims on wealth. Since the bank hasn’t created any wealth, the claims must be claims on wealth that already exists. These new claims have no immediate effect on the people who hold that wealth. Nothing changes for them, the wealth they hold is still theirs as long as they don’t exchange it for money. As long as they don’t sell their wealth, the increase in claims on that wealth changes nothing.\n\nThe people who are negatively effected by this increase in money are those who already have money. Since money is a claim on wealth, the value of each unit of money equals \\[amount of wealth in existence\\] divided by \\[amount of money in existence\\]. Since the amount of wealth has not changed, but the amount of money has increased, the value of existing money falls. More money spread out over the same amount of wealth means each unit of money will buy less wealth. This is what everyone knows as inflation, and as everyone who has experienced it knows, the money they hold as savings or receive as income becomes less valuable the more inflation occurs.\n\nWho benefits from this? Well, the borrower may benefit in some cases. They receive the newly created money and are able to spend it and acquire wealth they haven’t yet put in the effort to produce. So they get to enjoy unearned rewards now. Also, since it takes time for holders of wealth to realize how much inflation has occurred, they will often exchange their wealth for money at a price lower than the increase in money supply would indicate. So the price of a purchased item will often continue to increase after the borrower acquires it, and they benefit from the increase in prices by paying back their loan with money that is less valuable than it was when they borrowed it. Of course the interest charges negate some of the benefit, but often not all of it, so borrowing money can end up being very beneficial to a borrower in many situations.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary is the bank itself. They create the money from nothing, with no opportunity cost or sacrifice necessary. In effect, they are able to use the new money to transfer wealth from holders of wealth to borrowers, at the expense of holders of money. And of course as soon as that transfer is complete, the holders of wealth become new holders of money and begin to suffer the effects of inflation too. Meanwhile the bank requires the borrower to repay the loan, with interest attached.\n\nWhen an individual makes a loan, the interest charged is payment for the opportunity cost of not being able to enjoy the benefits of spending that money now. However for banks, there is no opportunity cost in making a loan. So the bank receives interest as a reward from the borrower for transferring wealth to them at the expense of holders of money. A kind of sharing of the spoils of theft, if you will. Of course they would never describe it that way, but if you understand what’s actually happening it seems like the only accurate explanation.\n\nSo we see who gets rewarded by the banking system, and who gets punished. Those who get rewarded are bankers, who collect interest from loaning out money they didn’t actually have, and are able to enrich themselves by spending that collected interest to purchase real wealth. Sometimes borrowers are also rewarded, meaning the people who consume things they haven’t produced by borrowing the money to buy them get to enjoy immediate gratification, and then over a period of time pay back an amount of money that has lost so much value it would no longer be enough to buy the item they have already been enjoying.\n\nAnd the people who get punished are those who save and hold money. Those people are the ones who produce value and defer consumption, the ones whose pro-social behavior and delayed gratification make capital formation and modern civilization possible.\n\nThe purpose and effect of banking, and creation of new money through bank loans, is to redistribute wealth. The incentive structure means access to wealth is stolen from those with the most socially desirable behavior, the most effective producers and most frugal savers who hold money they’ve earned for future use. The stolen wealth is given to those with the least socially desirable behavior, those who consume more than they produce and live beyond their means, being a net detriment to civilization, and to the parasitic banking class who collect interest as a reward for their theft.\n\nThe anti-civilizational outcomes of this perverse incentive structure, and the lie it’s built on (“money in the bank is the same as money in your wallet”) have only become more obvious and harder to ignore over the decades. Without a fundamental change to the basic design and function of the modern financial system, expect this trend to continue.\n\nForewarned is forearmed.","sig":"49a9bbbf4d710cd768a370ccfbc727eb1c8178564f369d994602afccc2ae9b25c9aa2ad1ff2f89ef78e2b88d970ee39b624538dbf16c46313d692e20f863ac38"},"naddr1qqty6mmwv4uj6stn94zhzatfw3uj6v3ew35kwagpzpmhxue69uhkummnw3ezuamfdejsyg9udnx38ge0jnfk2ex6er6evwsdd8zc8jvksdqmhhe83vsl2vycuspsgqqqw4rsaq3tkn":{"kind":30023,"id":"3504856842997b5c838159e1c4366dac270e9b536450ce1a9253dd356ebf832b","pubkey":"bc6ccd13a32f94d36564dac8f5963a0d69c583c9968341bbdf278b21f53098e4","created_at":1735437340,"tags":[["title","Money As Equity"],["summary","We use debt as money, but is that really the best system?..."],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/94548516adbe605b20022b001232185683a4453e4d991471bc9e3e343ed717d6.jpg"],["t","money"],["t","banking"],["t","finance"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","wealth"],["t","philosophy"],["t","nostr"],["published_at","1735437340"],["d","Money-As-Equity-29tigu"]],"content":"I’ve been thinking about the topic of this article for a while, but what really motivated me to sit down and write was a comment Matt Odell made on the Citadel Dispatch podcast recently. He said,\n\n\u003e To me, that’s the cool part about Bitcoin, is that it’s this interoperable, permissionless, global network. And it’s almost like a shared equity, right? If you own Bitcoin the asset, it’s like we all share equity in this almost like a startup equity. And anything we do, and a lot of times it’s out of greed too. It’s not out of benevolence. You don’t have to be like a charitable person. But you know, if Strike benefits from something or Unchained Capital benefits from something, then Manchankura in Africa benefits from it as well at the same time, which is like a crazy concept. I feel like people just don’t really appreciate that.\n\nWhen you start going down the “what is money?” rabbit hole, debt quickly comes into focus. You try to understand what it is, how it works, and why the world has so much of it and seemingly more by the second. Eventually you’ll discover that the “money” we use today is mostly just debt, created by banks when they make loans, and treated the same as the cash in your wallet. Until too many people try to withdraw their “money” from the bank, and the bank doesn’t have nearly enough cash to meet the withdrawals and collapses into insolvency. Which it always was, only no one realized who was swimming naked until the tide went out.\n\nEquity is a related financial concept that doesn’t typically come up when studying money. The definition of the word as it’s used financially is something like “a risk interest or ownership right in property.” In simple terms, equity refers to ownership of something. For example, if you have a house that’s worth $500,000 and you have no mortgage or loans against the house, you have equity in the house of 100% of its value, or $500,000. If you have a mortgage of $250,000, you currently have 50% equity in the house, or you “own” half the value of the house.\n\nIt’s also often used to refer to shares issued by publicly traded companies. The shares represent a partial ownership of, or equity in, the company. If a company has issued 1,000 shares of stock and you own 10 shares, you have a 1% ownership of that company. That ownership give you certain privileges, such as dividends paid out from profits the company makes and potentially ownership of an increasingly valuable company, if it continues to be successful.\n\n### Money: Debt or Equity? \n\nThe current fractionally reserved fiat banking system primarily uses debt as money. There’s a small amount of base money, which consists of physical cash and a digital equivalent of cash called bank reserves, which are held in a ledger in banks’ accounts at the Federal Reserve and are used to settle transactions between banks. But this base money only makes up a small percentage of the total money supply. The bulk of the “money” consists of bank deposits, which are essentially IOUs created by banks when they issue loans under the fractional reserve system. When a bank makes a loan, they don’t actually give the borrower base money, for example a stack of physical cash, in most cases. Instead what they give is an liability entry in the bank’s balance sheet ledger that says “the bank owes the borrower this amount of dollars.” At the same time, on the asset side of the balance sheet they create another entry that says “the borrower owes the bank this amount of dollars” with details on how and when the loan must be repaid.\n\nThen through the magic of banking, the borrower can transfer the numbers representing the amount the bank owes them to someone else, and now the bank owes that other person a certain number of dollars. And so on down the line. This can continue indefinitely, with people exchanging bank IOUs with each other in perpetuity, and no actual base money dollars needing to be exchanged. With help from a deliberate effort by banks to conceal the real nature of their activities, these credit/debt ledger entries function as, and for all practical purposes become, money. The only thing that can upset the apple cart is too many people trying to effectively exit the banking system at once, by trying to withdraw the money in their account. At that point reality sets in. The fact that the numbers in their account didn’t actually represent base money but rather just debt that the bank owes the depositor becomes obvious when the bank run reveals that the bank doesn’t have enough actual base money to settle its debt.\n\nThis system has a lot of serious problems, besides the fact that it’s fundamentally based on a lie. For one, all the bank deposits are created by making loans, which means they’re all debt, which means they all have to be paid back with interest. That’s a problem for two reasons. One, paying back the debt destroys money, which artificially disrupts the economy by distorting prices as the amount of money in the economy rises and falls arbitrarily depending on new loan issuance versus debt repayment. Two, when the loan is made, only the amount of the principle is created in bank deposits. The interest isn’t. That means new loans have to be made to pay the interest on the existing loans. That basically guarantees that the amount of debt in the economy will continue to rise indefinitely, because the only way it could go down is for the banking system as it currently exists to collapse, or to be “bailed out” with massive injections of newly created base money to offset loans that can’t be paid back. That, coincidentally, is what Quantitative Easing is; an injection of newly created base money to provide liquidity to pay back debt without having to issue new debt to do it.\n\nNow let’s think for a minute about equity and how it might compare and contrast with the current system in relation to money.\n\nTo begin with, I understand money as a ledger of deferred consumption. If you haven’t heard that concept before, it would probably be helpful to familiarize yourself with my thought process laid out here.\n\nnaddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp0rve5f6xtu56djkfkkg7ktr5rtfckpun95rgxaa7futy86npx8yqq247t2dvet9q4tsg4qng36lxe6kc4nftayyy89kua2\n\nDeferred consumption is what makes capital formation and civilization possible. People work to create things that they don’t immediately consume, and those new tools and processes make it easier to create more things in the future with less effort, which raises the productivity of the economy (getting more output for less input) and makes society as a whole wealthier. Those new tools and processes can then be used to more efficiently create other tools and processes, which increases productivity even further, and the whole thing compounds on itself in an exponential curve of increasing productivity and increasing wealth. But it all starts with and relies on someone somewhere putting in effort now, to create something they won’t benefit from until later.\n\nPlanting a seed is a perfect example. When you have a bushel of wheat, you have two choices. You can consume it now. That’s immediately satisfying and keeps you fed for say a month. Or you can plant it. That’s hard work, and you also have to defer consumption of the wheat. You can’t eat it now, you have to satisfy your hunger some other way. It also takes work throughout the year to cultivate and care for the wheat crop, time you could have spent doing something more fun, if you had just consumed the wheat directly instead of planting it. The flip side is, at harvest time, you might harvest 50 bushels of wheat from the 1 bushel you didn’t eat 6 months ago. That 50 bushels could now feed you for 4 years, and you can sell 30 bushels, keep 12 for your own use over the next year, and plant 8 for harvest next year. Then in a year you might harvest 400 bushels, etc. You can see how a little bit of deferred consumption today can lead to a lot of reward in the future. There’s even a term for being short-sighted and sacrificing future rewards for present gratification, “eating the seed corn,” which comes directly from this farming wisdom.\n\nThe same principle applies to business equity. When you start a business, you invest in some way into building something that isn’t immediately rewarding, but that you expect will yield more production in the future than your initial investment. You might invest your own time and effort, resources that you’ve gathered, money, or any number of other forms of value. The same applies to a public company that issues equity as shares of stock. Anyone can invest in the company by purchasing shares, which gives them a partial ownership of the company and its future growth and production. All those forms of investment, to acquire equity, are different forms of deferred consumption. You have to give up something you could have now, for something you hope to have in the future. You could spend the time now curled up in bed binge-watching Netflix. You could spend your effort strolling down the boardwalk eating an ice cream cone. You could spend your money on that pricey designer bag that all your girlfriends will be jealous of. All those things would be immediately gratifying. But they all have a long-term cost.\n\nWhat happens when you defer consumption instead, and acquire equity? If things go the way you hoped and planned, and the company you founded or invested in is successful, it will eventually produce more than the initial consumption that you deferred. Your equity will become more valuable with time. Why? Because like we pointed out, deferred consumption and capital formation increases efficiency, which leads to compounding returns in productivity and value.\n\nIf the company is extremely successful and you defer your consumption long enough, those returns can be very large. For example, if you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in 2007, that equity today, 17 years later, would have returned over $80,000. The first iPhone was released in 2007 for $500. So you could have bought two iPhones instead of making that initial investment in Amazon. But if you deferred that consumption instead, even though the price of the iPhone has doubled by 2024, you could still buy eighty new iPhones with the equity from that initial investment instead of two, or a 40x return in “iPhone inflation adjusted” terms.\n\nNow let’s make a mental leap and compare equity in a business with money. We’ve defined money as a ledger of deferred consumption. You could define business equity as a ledger of consumption deferred to establish ownership of a business instead. You have the stock, the equity in the company, to represent that you invested your time, effort, resources or money into building a business rather than consuming it on something for your immediate gratification. These definitions seem very similar, almost synonymous. We could also consider the economy as a whole to be very similar to a business. As consumption is deferred, more capital is created in the economy, it becomes more efficient and productive, more outputs are created with fewer inputs, and the economy as a whole grows in value.\n\nBusiness equity represents ownership in a company, both in the current value of that company, and in its future productivity and value. Why? Because the future productivity and value wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the deferred consumption of the initial investment. If Jeff Bezos hadn’t started Amazon, and investors hadn’t provided the money by buying shares to enable the company to grow the way it did, all the productivity and value of Amazon today wouldn’t exist. That’s why it’s fair for the person who only invested $1,000 in 2007 to gain a return of 40x that investment today.\n\nSo if business equity represents ownership of a company earned by deferred consumption, what does the deferred consumption of money itself grant ownership of? Well, money can be exchanged for any good or service available on the market, throughout the entire economy. In my opinion, money should represent ownership of the future productivity and value of the economy as a whole. **Money should be equity in civilization itself.** The future productivity and value of the economy depends on the deferred consumption of today, just like the future productivity and value of a company depends on the deferred consumption of its initial founders and investors.\n\n### Slices of Pie \n\nThere’s an issue that needs to be addressed here, one that the savvy investor will have noticed already. Equity in a growing and successful company becomes more valuable over time. Yet even though the economy as a whole is becoming more productive and more valuable, money as we know it today becomes less valuable over time. The $1,000 Amazon equity went from being worth two iPhones, to being worth eighty iPhones. Over the same time period, the $1,000 itself went from being worth two iPhones to being worth one iPhone. What gives?\n\nTo understand, we have to look at the differences between how equity is created and how money is created.\n\nThe most simple example is a company that’s owned by a single individual. They hold 100% of the equity. You could call that one share. Think of the company like a pie, but the pie hasn’t been cut, so there’s only one “slice.” Over time, if the company is successful, the company “pie” grows larger. But as it grows, it doesn’t get cut into more slices, the one “slice” just gets bigger and bigger. So the one “share” of equity the owner holds is still one share, it’s just a bigger and more valuable share.\n\nPublic companies generally function similarly. They start out “going public” by issuing shares. Each share is like a small slice of the company “pie.” Say the company issues 1,000 shares, each share represents a slice of pie 1/1,000th the size of the whole company pie. If the company grows, it won’t commonly issue more shares, although that can happen in certain situations. Instead, the shares will continue to represent 1/1,000th of the company, it will just be 1/1,000 of a bigger and bigger “pie” as time goes on. If the company doubles in productivity and value, each share will be twice as valuable, while still only being one share.\n\nThat doesn’t have to be the case. The company can, and sometimes does, issue more shares of stock. The reason this isn’t commonly done, though, is that it’s usually bad for the holders of the stock. If the company issues another 1,000 shares, there are now 2,000 pieces of ownership of the company. The company is no bigger, it’s just divided into more pieces. It’s like cutting each slice of pie in half. You don’t have more pie, you just have more pieces of pie. And as someone who already had a piece of pie, your piece suddenly got cut in half. Of course you probably won’t be too happy about that situation. In effect, the value of the deferred consumption of your initial investment is being taken away from you and given to someone who didn’t defer consumption and therefore didn’t contribute to the success the company has already experienced.\n\nContrast that to how money is created. If you compare the chart of money supply below with the chart of GDP, you'll see they both go up over time.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/6d9b90a40b1b215749b7df39145cd85a274aa457cbcb6566793dad7d306e1879.png\"\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/1439498c472180f695295959b1991d0b9e9c7f2d6d72aabb15511141e10a921b.jpg\"\u003e\n\nGDP is an (admittedly flawed) measure of the goods and services produced by an economy each year. It's similar to a company's revenue. As a company or economy grows and becomes more productive and valuable, the revenue or GDP rises. The thing about the economy though, is that money, the “shares” of an economy representing the deferred consumption that enables it to grow, is constantly being created by banks making new loans. So as the economy grows, the number of “slices” of the economy grows even faster. When the number of “slices” of an economy grow faster than the economy itself, the “size” or value of each slice falls over time. This is what we call inflation. It takes more “slices” of the economy to buy something than it did in the past, even though the economy is more efficient at producing that good or service than it was in the past.\n\nYou can imagine how it might look if a company managed its equity the way the banks manage our money. Each year, as the company grew, the board of directors would issue enough new shares of stock to make sure the value of each share fell that year. They could take the approach the US banking system takes and “target 2% inflation,” in other words try to make the share value fall 2% every year. So if the productivity and value of the company increased by 10%, the board would issue 12% more shares to dilute the existing shareholders by the full amount of the increased value of the company, plus an additional 2%. This would help ensure the share price fell 2% every year. The new shares would be distributed to existing shareholders arbitrarily by decision of the board, with a big chunk going to the board members themselves. This would be highly profitable for the board, leaving them with a larger slice of company equity every year, while being very damaging to all the other shareholders.\n\nIn fact, one might wonder why an investor would ever hold equity in a company, when the company's stated policy was to reduce the value of that equity by 2% every year. The answer is, nobody would. It would be idiotic.\n\nThen one might wonder why anyone would hold money, “shares” of an economy, when the stated policy of the banks managing the issuance of that money is to reduce the value of each dollar by 2% every year. The answer to that is just as simple: they have to.\n\nNobody has to buy stock issued by a particular company in order to survive day to day. But it’s impossible to survive day to day in the modern US economy without using the money issued by the US banking system. You get paid in dollars for your work, and get charged in dollars for every item you buy. You need at least a certain amount of dollars just to live day to day. Of course those who understand the financial system make every effort to hold as few dollars as possible, and to invest the excess as soon as possible into some asset that will hold its value over time. Of course that doesn’t actually get rid of the dollar, just transfers it to someone else. Then the new holder of the dollar has to quickly exchange it with someone else for a better asset, and so on in an endless repeating loop. No matter how many people invest in assets, the full quantity of dollars in existence is always held by someone, and those people are continually being diluted by the issuance of new dollars by banks creating bank deposits when they make loans.\n\n### Implications \n\nIf what I’m proposing is correct, there would be massive implications in changing the way money works in the economy from the current credit/debt issuance controlled by banks, to a system that functions more like equity issued by a responsible and profitable company. Getting into the details of those implications in various specific areas will take many more articles, but I just want to mention a few to get your mind running, then circle all the way back to where we started.\n\nImagine if the money every person earned went up in value as the economy grew. It would be like owning equity in the broadest possible index of businesses, better even than owning an S\u0026P 500 ETF or mutual fund. And it would take no effort. There would be no need to open a brokerage account, decide what companies or funds to invest in, and pay commissions and fees to the brokerage for the privilege. There would be no need for a 401k. All that would be needed is to work at the job you’re best at, consume less than you produce, and save the difference. The economic growth created by increased productivity would automatically accrue equally across the population to those who were best at being productive and deferring consumption. Working hard, being frugal, and saving for the future would automatically be rewarded. All the incentives would be realigned to benefit those who contribute most to capital formation and future economic prosperity.\n\nIt would be much easier for those with low income to get ahead financially. Any amount they manage to save, no matter how small, would increase in value over time. Contrast that with the current system where a small amount of savings continually becomes worth less over time, encouraging people to consume more than they need in the moment since their small savings will shrink to insignificance quickly.\n\nYou can easily think of lots of other changes that would happen as a result of using money that functions more like equity than our current system does.\n\nBut to tie all this back to the quote at the beginning, I think what Matt is seeing and feeling is the beginnings of a more equity-like monetary system. I think the properties of Bitcoin, specifically its predictable and limited supply issuance, make it behave like equity in a well-managed, productive company. That “company” just happens to be the global and permissionless group of every person who chooses to save and transact in Bitcoin instead of the current credit/debt money. And the fact that even self-serving actions toward productive goals end up benefitting every member of the network is exactly what we’d expect in a truly capitalist economic system. Whenever someone works to grow the “pie” in order to make their slice bigger, the fact that the pie is growing means everyone else’s slice is growing as well. And that’s a beautiful thing.\n\nI’m excited to see how this theory plays out over time, because from my point of view, the potential of moving to a more equity-like monetary system is both massive and extremely optimistic.","sig":"ebc434a8478711ff6006616783d142a01e1c6ecc038a5baca7495c616f170cbe19ba261907576612d9a3aabd8c8ec94f899ce4b0be177d1eb5ade96cf59e6977"},"naddr1qqu8xmmkv4ex26t8de68jtt5dpex7at8dqsx6ct5dpjk6ct5d93hxgrrdpshqar9wgsr2w3qwpex7mmxyphkvgrhdaexkqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46qyg9ljhs6gk74a3w2p4pq7n64e5qkghrcf86hlhgnhrz6lmzwhhxgfqpsgqqqw4rsekhklk":{"kind":30023,"id":"f955a663f5bf8c685713d32ef0cfd6eed7af8fea12447af7dbf70d223d29c66b","pubkey":"bf95e1a45bd5ec5ca0d420f4f55cd01645c7849f57fdd13b8c5afec4ebdcc848","created_at":1744805487,"tags":[["title","Sovereignty Through Mathematics Chapter 5: Proof of Work"],["summary","Bitcoin Infinity Academy - Course 1 Part 5"],["image","https://m.primal.net/QRwg.png"],["published_at","1744805487"],["d","sovereignty-through mathematics chapter 5: proof of work"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","nostr"],["t","philosophy"],["t","books"],["t","0"],["r","wss://feeds.nostr.band/audio"],["r","wss://filter.nostr.wine/"],["r","wss://nostr.wine/"],["r","wss://nrelay.c-stellar.net/"],["r","wss://purplepag.es/"],["r","wss://relay.nostr.band/"],["r","wss://relay.primal.net/"],["r","wss://nostr-relay.algotech.io/"],["r","wss://nostr-relay.bitcoin.ninja/"]],"content":"This is a part of the Bitcoin Infinity Academy course on Knut Svanholm's book Bitcoin: Sovereignty Through Mathematics. For more information, check out our[ Geyser page](https://geyser.fund/project/infinity)!\n\n## Proof of Work\n\nZoom out of time for a while and imagine how the antlers of a magnificent moose buck evolved into being. The main purpose of big antlers in nature is believed to be a way for the buck to impress potential mates. They’re somewhat akin to the feathers of a peacock, or the shroud of any male bird for that matter. The animal is trying to signal that it can thrive in its environment *despite* its enormous appendage. It’s there to tell the potential mate that this specific specimen will bring her strong, healthy offspring. These are all evolutionary metaphors, of course — the animal itself is probably unaware of signaling anything. For such antlers to evolve into being, a whole lot of moose will have to die early, or at least not get a chance to reproduce, over thousands of generations. In other words, a lot of resources need to be wasted. All of this for the animal to prove its value to potential spouses. Therefore, from the surviving moose's point of view, the aforementioned resources were sacrificed rather than wasted.\n\nThe Proof of Work algorithm in Bitcoin does a similar thing. It enables miners to sacrifice a lot of electricity, a real-world resource, to find a certain number, thereby proving that they had to commit a lot of time and effort to do this. Time, by the way, is the scarcest of all resources. Because of all this, a Bitcoin miner is very reluctant to sell Bitcoin at a net loss. The electricity has already been used when the Bitcoin pops into existence, and the miner has no other means of getting his money back than by selling the Bitcoin for more than the cost of the electricity it took to produce them. This is assuming that the mining rig itself has already been paid for. Proof of Work is a way of converting computing power into money, in a sense. Yes, these rigs consume a lot of energy, but the energy consumed correlates directly to the actual value of the created token. Any decrease in the energy expenditure would also lead to a decrease in the value of the token. Not necessarily the price but the actual value. This is the main reason mining algorithms can’t be less resource-consuming or more energy-efficient. “Wasting” energy is the whole point. No “waste,” no proof of commitment.\n\nThe fundamental principles of Bitcoin were set in stone in 2008, and block #0, the so-called genesis block, was mined in January 2009. In Bitcoin, a block of transactions is created every ten minutes. In its first four years of existence, these blocks included a 50 Bitcoin block reward given to the miner who found the block. Every four years, this reward is halved so that the maximum amount of Bitcoin that can ever be claimed can never exceed just short of 21 million. Every 2016th block, or roughly every two weeks, the difficulty of finding a new block is re-calibrated so that a block will be found every ten minutes on average. The value of this feature and the impact it has on coin issuance is often understated. It is one of the features of Bitcoin that separates it from gold and other assets in one of the most subtle yet most powerful ways. When the price of gold or silver or oil or any other asset goes up, producing that asset becomes more profitable, and more resources are allocated to produce more of it faster. This, in turn, evens out the price as the total supply of said asset increases.\n\nGold has been able to maintain or increase its value long term over time because of its high stock-to-flow ratio. Stock refers to the supply of an asset currently available on the market. Flow refers to the amount added to the stock per time unit. The bigger the stock in relation to the flow, the less of an impact on the total supply an increase in the price of a specific asset has. In Bitcoin, a price increase has virtually no impact at all on the coin issuance rate (the flow) since the difficulty of finding the next block in the chain is constantly being optimized for a strict issuance schedule. No other asset has ever behaved like this and we are yet to find out what impact its existence will have on the world economy.\n\nSo, how does one mine a block in the Bitcoin blockchain? In short, the mining process goes something like this: every active node in the Bitcoin network stores a copy of the mempool, which contains all Bitcoin transactions that haven’t been confirmed yet. The miner puts as many transactions as the block size allows into the block, usually selecting those with the highest fee first. He then adds a random number, called a nonce, and produces a hash of the entire thing using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. A hashing algorithm turns data into a string of numbers. If the resulting hash begins with a specific number of zeros decided by the current difficulty of the network, the miner wins the block reward, collects all the fees, and gets to put the block on the blockchain.\n\nThe beauty of the system is that it is trivial for the nodes in the network to verify the block so that no double spending can occur, but it’s near impossible to forge a fake hash since the probability of finding one that begins with as many zeros as the difficulty of the Bitcoin network demands is extremely low. To a layman's eye, a hash beginning with a bunch of zeros just looks like a random number, but a person who understands the mathematics behind it sees a different thing. The zeros act as proof of an enormous commitment to trying out different nonces and trying to find a perfect match. If you’re able to understand these huge numbers, you quickly realize that this number must have been created by devoting computing power to doing just that on an absolutely massive scale. The proof is in those zeros.\n\nIf you compare just the hash rate of the top five so-called cryptocurrencies, it is obvious that Bitcoin is on a different level security-wise. From a hash rate to security perspective, the Ethereum blockchain is about five times as ineffective, and the Litecoin blockchain about ten times as ineffective as the Bitcoin blockchain at the time of writing.1 This in addition to the obviously more centralized nature of these “alternatives”.\n\nSome of the futurists and doomsday prophets mentioned in chapter four as the people most likely to warn us about the dangers of the impending Artificial Intelligence singularity, believe that we already live in a simulated reality. The main argument for this worldview is that since simulations and computer graphics seem to be getting better at an ever-accelerating rate, we can’t really know if we already live in a simulation or not. To put it another way, we simply have no way of knowing if we live in The Matrix or if our perceived reality is all there is. A really mind-blowing counterargument to this theory is that Bitcoin’s Proof of Work algorithm would eventually slow down the simulation since Proof of Work is verifiable and can’t be simulated itself. Computing power would have to be sacrificed by some entity somewhere, regardless. One question remains, though: can the inhabitants of a simulated reality actually feel or measure a slowdown of the very simulation they live in?\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1\\.

A couple of decades ago I ran my own Linux and Mac servers, and enjoyed building and maintaining them. I was by no means an expert sys admin, but had my share of cron jobs, scripts, and custom configuration files. While it was fun and educational, software updates and hardware upgrades often meant hours of restoring and troubleshooting my systems.\n\nFast forward to family and career (especially going into management) and I didn't have time for all that. Having things just work became more important than playing with the tech. As I got older, the more I appreciated K.I.S.S. (for those who don't know: Keep It Simple Stupid).\n\nSo when the idea of running a node came to mind, I explored the different options. I decided I needed a balance between a Raspberry Pi (possibly underpowered depending on use) and a full-blown Linux server (too complex and time-consuming to build and maintain). That led me to Umbrel OS, Start9, Casa OS, and similar platforms. Due to its simplicity (very plug and play), nice design, and being open source: [GitHub](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel)), I chose Umbrel OS on a Beelink mini PC with 16GB of RAM and a 2TB NVMe internal drive. Though Umbrel OS is not very flexible and can't really be customized, its App Store made setting up a node (among other things) fairly easy, and it has been running smoothly since. Would the alternatives have been better? Perhaps, but so far I'm happy with my choice.\n\n![Beelink](https://jtron.net/images/articles/node/beelinksm.jpg)\n\n# Server Setup\n\nI'm also no expert in OpSec (I'd place myself in the category of somewhat above vague awareness). I wanted a secure way to connect to my Umbrel without punching holes in my router and forwarding ports. I chose Tailscale for this purpose. Those who are distrustful of corporate products might not like this option but again, balancing risk with convenience it seemed reasonable for my needs. If you're hiding state (or anti-state) secrets, extravagant wealth, or just adamant about privacy, you would probably want to go with an entirely different setup.\n\nOnce I had Tailscale installed on Umbrel OS, my mobile device and laptop, I could securely connect to the server from anywhere through a well designed browser UI. I then installed the following from the Umbrel App Store:\n\n- Bitcoin Core\n- Electrum Personal Server (Electrs)\n\nAt this point I could set wallets on my laptop ([Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com/[placeholder](url))) and phone ([BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/)) to use my node. I then installed:\n\n- Lightning Node (LND)\n- Alby Hub\n\n[Alby Hub](https://albyhub.com/) streamlines the process of opening and maintaining lightning channels, creating lightning wallets to send and receive sats, and zapping notes and users on Nostr. I have two main nsec accounts for Nostr and set up separate wallets on Alby Hub to track balances and transactions for each.\n\nOther apps I installed on Umbrel OS:\n\n- mempool\n- Bitcoin Explorer\n- LibreTranslate (some Nostr clients allow you to use your own translator)\n- Public Pool\n\n![Umbrel Dashboard](https://jtron.net/images/articles/node/dashboard.png)\n\nPublic Pool allows me to connect [Bitaxe](https://bitaxe.org/) solo miners (a.k.a. \"lottery\" miners) to my own mining pool for a (very) long shot at winning a Bitcoin block. It's also a great way to learn about mining, contribute to network decentralization, and generally tinker with electronics. Bitaxe miners are small open source single ASIC miners that you can run in your home with minimal technical knowledge and maintenance requirements.\n\n[Open Source Miners United (OSMU)](https://osmu.wiki/) is a great resource for anyone interesting in Bitaxe or other open source mining products (especially their Discord server).\n\n![Bitaxe Supras](https://jtron.net/images/articles/node/bitaxe.jpg)\n\nAlthough Umbrel OS is more or less limited to running software in its App Store (or Community App Store, if you trust the developer), you can install the Portainer app and run Docker images. I know next to nothing about Docker but wanted to see what I might be able to do with it. I was also interested in the Haven Nostr relay and found that there was indeed a docker image for it.\n\nAs stated before, I didn't want to open my network to the outside, which meant I wouldn't be able to take advantage of all the features Haven offers (since other users wouldn't be able to access it). I would however be able to post notes to my relay, and use its \"Blastr\" feature to send my notes to other relays.

Even when I was conducting quasi-legal retail operations, I always depended on the constitution to protect me from unreasonable searches and seizures. If I ever got busted, I figured I would just force the prosecution to take me through piece by piece every part of law enforcement's evidence gathering operations, which (especially with the local law enforcement in rural Missouri) likely would have trampled my civil rights. In retrospect, I was probably a lot more vulnerable than I wanted to admit, but this was years ago and I think I was tempting fate recreationally. I also imagined that a jury would never render a verdict against me, even with good evidence. And if they did, I would appeal it. Law school taught me to see the system as much more pliable than law enforcement wants anyone to think it is. Lacking shame is also an endearing quality.\n\nOne thing I spent a lot of time thinking about during these years, despite my stubborn insistence that everything would work out okay (which it mostly did), was my digital vulnerability. I was careful with what was said, how it was said, who is was said to. But never careful enough, and given the gist of the last few years and Big Tech's coziness with law enforcement, I should have abandoned most of my devices way sooner. \n\nNow, I no longer run an illicit Farmer's Market, but I am endlessly interested in erasing my fingerprints from prying eyes -- government or otherwise. That said, I don't mind having my name attached to my ideas. I recently convinced a friend to join Nostr and when he saw I was using my real name he couldn't believe it. If I was starting social media cold, I would encourage people to maintain a pseudonym. I have pseudonyms in various corners of the internet. They are probably too leaky to overcome basic scrutiny from a moderate hacker, but they give me a little distance. Probably my willful ignorance cropping up here again, but I live by a phrase I heard in a Sherlock Holmes film once: \"It's so over: it's covert.\" I just figure I can say and do enough to obfuscate my activities if someone tries to nail me down at some point. But, deeper than that, I can stop gladly handing over any trust to corporations that have a record of prying and spying. \n\nI don't trust Windows. I don't really trust Apple, although I remember the landmark case with the Sandy Hook shooter's phone, where Apple was refusing to unlock the thing. This gave me a bit of trust, but you can just feel the fingers of the company all over your devices. I also lost a lot of trust in Apple during the previous presidential campaign politics where every headline that was pushed from the Apple news app was overwhelmingly anti-Trump. I am not the biggest Trump guy by ANY stretch, but I found this to be just way too heavy-handed for what should be a politically agnostic news pushing application. \n\nI definitely don't trust any centralized social media. Facebook has burned so much trust over the years it is laughable that they control rural communities the way they do. When the cat is out of the bag on Nostr, I hope there is a mass exodus. It won't be a mass exodus, but even a slow and progressive exodus would be fine. Starve out the big guys. Don't give them the data and the clicks. \n\nTwitter feels better, but not by a ton. There is enough of a desire to be the \"everything app\" that i don't want any part of it anymore. Also, the free tier is shit -- I had premium plus for a while until the last couple of months when the price went way up, and it was unclear whether I had access to the full AI features of Grok, so I ditched it. About the same time I became active on Nostr, so it hasn't bothered me much.\n\nI'm not full carnivore, but I have eaten more steaks in the last year than in the past. I'm not full open source, but I am weaning myself off the spy-machines. \n\nI will be installing Linux on my PC (once my graphic card gets here from Germany), and it will be slow and probably painful at times, but I am getting away from it. I will also be installing GrapheneOS on my backup phone, so that I am familiar and accustomed to escaping the ivory towers in that realm too.\n\nLittle by little, but it's hard to overstate how much more hopeful life feels when you rebel against the digital overlords. Open-source money is better, so might as well bitcoin-ify the rest of my networks, too.","sig":"1184cd9b821eaec7857bb67d2fff26ee58d1232c955263a7054b5a4f31729a6fd38b13442304186b665c2cac502ce08365bf14c6b5949cafc8276362784d9670"},"naddr1qqw5vetpw36hyefd23hk6t25dp5k2unrv4kxjm3dxvursar8xsq3qamnwvaz7tmwdaehgu3wwa5kuegzyp3at8dc62dtu2wmwwqtawgjhrmqqgmnx2mvn9utyzrffe97zu8k7qcyqqq823cx592fd":{"kind":30023,"id":"d1c058ae727064e2531a8067c5915c1d818ad1853655ea55bf30fb086fe50144","pubkey":"63d59db8d29abe29db7380beb912b8f600237332b6c9978b208694e4be170f6f","created_at":1732731361,"tags":[["title","Feature: Tom Thiercelin"],["summary","Sésimbra"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/aa484abc6e3f756e9f7930d1e5945bae471e1db9d8c842ec542d30728ec9da78.jpg"],["t","noicemag"],["t","photography"],["t","nostr"],["t","grownostr"],["t","photostr"],["t","plebchain"],["published_at","1732731361"],["d","Feature-Tom-Thiercelin-388tg4"]],"content":"*Tom Thiercelin is a French director and photographer based in Southern Europe.

image/jpeg?\n    [ \"output\", \"text/plain\" ],\n    // Do we really need to define relays? cant the DVM respond on the relays it saw the request on?\n    [ \"relays\",  \"wss://relay.unknown.cloud/\", \"wss://nos.lol/\" ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis is a request to generate text using an LLM model\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": 5050,\n  // Why is the content empty? wouldn't it be better to have the prompt in the content?\n  \"content\": \"\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    // Why use an indexable tag? are we ever going to lookup prompts?\n    // Also the type \"prompt\" isn't in NIP-90, this should probably be \"text\"\n    [ \"i\", \"What is the capital of France?\", \"prompt\" ],\n    [ \"p\", \"c4878054cff877f694f5abecf18c7450f4b6fdf59e3e9cb3e6505a93c4577db2\" ],\n    [ \"relays\", \"wss://relay.primal.net\" ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis is a request for content recommendation \n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": 5300,\n  \"content\": \"\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    // Its fine ignoring this param, but what if the client actually needs exactly 200 \"results\"\n    [ \"param\", \"max_results\", \"200\" ],\n    // The spec never mentions requesting content for other users.\n    // If a DVM didn't understand this and responded to this request it would provide bad data\n    [ \"param\", \"user\", \"b22b06b051fd5232966a9344a634d956c3dc33a7f5ecdcad9ed11ddc4120a7f2\" ],\n    [ \"relays\", \"wss://relay.primal.net\", ],\n    [ \"p\", \"ceb7e7d688e8a704794d5662acb6f18c2455df7481833dd6c384b65252455a95\" ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis is a request to create a OP_RETURN message on bitcoin\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": 5901,\n  // Again why is the content empty when we are sending human readable text?\n  \"content\": \"\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    // and again, using an indexable tag on an input that will never need to be looked up\n    [\"i\", \"09/01/24 SEC Chairman on the brink of second ETF approval\", \"text\"]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nMy point isn't that these event schema's aren't understandable but why are they using the same schema? each use-case is different but are they all required to use the same `i` tag format as input and could support all 4 types of inputs.\n## Lack of libraries\n\nWith all these different types of inputs, params, and outputs its verify difficult if not impossible to build libraries for DVMs\n\nIf a simple text translation request can have an `event` or `text` as inputs, a `payment-required`  status at any point in the flow, partial results, or responses from 10+ DVMs whats the best way to build a translation library for other nostr clients to use?\n\nAnd how do I build a DVM framework for the server side that can handle multiple inputs of all four types (`url`, `text`, `event`, `job`) and clients are sending all the requests in slightly differently.\n## Supporting payments is impossible\n\nThe way NIP-90 is written there isn't much details about payments. only a `payment-required` status and a generic `amount` tag\n\nBut the way things are now every DVM is implementing payments differently. some send a bolt11 invoice, some expect the client to NIP-57 zap the request event (or maybe the status event), and some even ask for a subscription. and we haven't even started implementing NIP-61 nut zaps or cashu\nA few are even formatting the `amount` number wrong or denominating it in sats and not mili-sats\n\nBuilding a client or a library that can understand and handle all of these payment methods is very difficult. for the DVM server side its worse.\nA DVM server presumably needs to support all 4+ types of payments if they want to get the most sats for their services and support the most clients.\n\nAll of this is made even more complicated by the fact that a DVM can ask for payment at any point during the job process. this makes sense for some types of compute, but for others like translations or user recommendation / search it just makes things even more complicated.\n\nFor example, If a client wanted to implement a timeline page that showed the notes of all the pubkeys on a recommended list. what would they do when the selected DVM asks for payment at the start of the job? or at the end? or worse, only provides half the pubkeys and asks for payment for the other half. building a UI that could handle even just two of these possibilities is complicated.\n\n## NIP-89 is being abused\n\nNIP-89 is \"Recommended Application Handlers\" and the way its describe in the nips repo is\n\n\u003e a way to discover applications that can handle unknown event-kinds\n\nNot \"a way to discover everything\"\n\nIf I wanted to build an application discovery app to show all the apps that your contacts use and let you discover new apps then it would have to filter out ALL the DVM advertisement events. and that's not just for making requests from relays\n\nIf the app shows the user their list of \"recommended applications\" then it either has to understand that everything in the 5xxx kind range is a DVM and to show that is its own category or show a bunch of unknown \"favorites\" in the list which might be confusing for the user.\n## In conclusion\n\nMy point in writing this article isn't that the DVMs implementations so far don't work, but that they will never work well because the spec is too broad. even with only a few DVMs running we have already lost interoperability.\n\nI don't want to be completely negative though because some things have worked. the \"DVM feeds\" work, although they are limited to a single page of results. text / event translations also work well and kind `5970` Event PoW delegation could be cool. but if we want interoperability, we are going to need to change a few things with NIP-90\n\nI don't think we can (or should) abandon NIP-90 entirely but it would be good to break it up into small NIPs or specs. break each \"kind\" of DVM request out into its own spec with its own definitions for expected inputs, outputs and flow.\n\nThen if we have simple, clean definitions for each kind of compute we want to distribute. we might actually see markets and services being built and used.","sig":"aefc387b12dfe4bc91bbf9067c8773614fbff6bca12b3892e63984d7d7c4eac84658729904f6d840b586005325431404d9682b8db6ec1f020fe5faee43e357ed"},"naddr1qqwryvpjx5knqdpdxg6z6mtpwf4kgmmhdckhgmeddehhxarjqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqpzemhxue69uhhyetvv9ujumn0wd68ytnzv9hxgq3qraustrrh5gjwt03zdj8syn9vmt2dwsv9t467m8c3gua636uxu89sxpqqqp65w5fdq6n":{"kind":30023,"id":"77287ae50930487a2b8cba2267f1618186c7161d467a2aa9a60add24f62b7fe7","pubkey":"1f79058c77a224e5be226c8f024cacdad4d741855d75ed9f11473ba8eb86e1cb","created_at":1745675630,"tags":[["title","Publishing articles from local files to Nostr"],["summary","A hacky bash script using yq, jq, and nak"],["published_at","1745498100"],["t","nostr"],["t","nip-23"],["d","2025-04-24-markdown-to-nostr"]],"content":"I'm currently using [this bash script][1] to publish [long-form content][2]\nfrom local Markdown files to Nostr relays.\n\nIt requires all of `yq`, `jq`, and `nak` to be installed.\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate a signed Nostr event and print it to the console:\n\n```bash\nmarkdown_to_nostr.sh article-filename.md\n```\n\nCreate a Nostr event and publish it to one or more relays:\n\n```bash\nmarkdown_to_nostr.sh article-filename.md ws://localhost:7777 wss://nostr.kosmos.org\n```\n\n## Markdown format\n\nYou can specify your metadata as YAML in a Front Matter header.

de dar-te as boas vindas à essa rede social descentralizada e sem censura. Creio eu que já tenha ouvido falar sobre o que ela é e como funciona parcialmente, caso não, existem dois sites (ao meu conhecimento) com boas informações, se chamam [nostr.com](nostr.com) e [nostr.how](nostr.how), mas darei mais à frente uma explicação básica.\n\nE já te dou um aviso: ***você precisa saber ler!***\n\nAqui irei tentar ajuntar o máximo de informações que conseguir para que não falte nada para você, e o que faltar, quero que você saiba como pesquisar. Cada parte de como funciona, como acessar, como criar, etc.\n\nUsarei como padrão neste artigo o #Amethyst, pois é o melhor e mais completo client para android, mas muitas das configurações nele podem ser visualizadas em outros clients. E para começar, vamos ver o que são clients.\n\n## **Clients**\n\nChamamos de clients (ou clientes em português) aqueles sites ou apps que dão acesso ao protocolo Nostr. Assim como para acessar à internet existem vários browsers (ou navegadores), para acessar o Nostr também existem vários clients, cada um voltado a um foco específico.\n\n### Amethyst\n\nO melhor e mais completo client para #android, nele você pode ter acesso de tudo um pouco. Lives, comunidades, chats, \"vídeos curtos\", hashtags, notas populares, e muito mais.\n\nNa versão da Play Store, existe uma funcionalidade de tradução usando o Google tradutor. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitorpamplona.amethyst\n\nEm outras lojas de apps e no repositório Github, o apk não possui essa função. https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst\n\nAqui tem um tutorial do Amethyst: nostr:nevent1qqsgqll63rw7nfn8ltszwx9k6cvycm7uw56e6rjty6lpwy4n9g7pe5qpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujumn0wd68ytnzvuhsygz8g3szf3lmg9j80mg5dlmkt24uvmsjwmht93svvpv5ws96gk0ltvpsgqqqqqqs7yma4t\n\n### Outros Clients\n\nAqui algumas pessoas expondo suas opiniões sobre certos clients: nostr:nevent1qqsdnrqszc2juykv6l2gnfmvhn2durt703ecvvakvmyfpgxju3q2grspzamhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuvrcvd5xzapwvdhk6tczyr604d4k2mwrx5gaywlcjqjdevtkvtdjq4hmtzswjxjhf6zv2p23qqcyqqqqqqghvkced nostr:nevent1qqsvqahwnljqcz3s3t5zjwyad5f67f7xc49lexu7vq5s2fxxskegv4spzemhxue69uhkummnw3ezuerpw3sju6rpw4ej7q3qvg9lk42rxugcdd4n667uy8gmvgfjp530n2307q9s93xuce3r7vzsxpqqqqqqzeykzw2 Eu mesmo gosto do Amethyst para android e [iris.to](iris.to) para web no PC.\n\nRecomendo à você dar uma olhada nesse site: [nostrapps.com](nostrapps.com)Ele possui todos os clients atuais do Nostr, com uma descrição e links direcionais para você.\n\n## **Nostr**\n\nAgora que você já sabe mais sobre os #clients, você pode acessar o Nostr segundo seu interesse de interface. Vamos ver o que uma IA nos diz sobre o Nostr:\n\n\"O #Nostr é um protocolo descentralizado e open source que permite a criação de redes sociais e outros aplicativos sem a necessidade de um servidor central. O nome é um acrônimo para *Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays* (Notas e Outras Coisas Transmitidas por Relays). Ele foi projetado para ser resistente à censura, oferecendo uma alternativa às plataformas tradicionais, onde os usuários têm controle total sobre seus dados.\n\n**Para que serve?**\\\nO Nostr serve como base para aplicações descentralizadas, como redes sociais, sistemas de pagamento instantâneo em Bitcoin (usando a rede Lightning) e interações diretas entre criadores e consumidores de conteúdo. Ele promove a liberdade de expressão e a privacidade, sem exigir informações pessoais como nome, e-mail ou número de telefone para criar uma conta.\n\n**Como funciona?**\\\nO protocolo utiliza dois componentes principais: **clientes** e **relays**. Os clientes são aplicações que os usuários usam para interagir com a rede, enquanto os relays são servidores que armazenam e transmitem mensagens. Cada usuário tem uma chave criptográfica única, que garante a autenticidade e a integridade das mensagens. Os relays são independentes, o que significa que, se um relay for bloqueado ou cair, os usuários podem continuar se conectando através de outros.\n\nEm resumo, o Nostr é uma revolução na forma como nos conectamos online, oferecendo liberdade, privacidade e controle aos usuários.\"\n\n\\-Perplexity AI\n\nSe você chegou aqui, é porque ouviu em algum lugar ou de alguém, algo parecido com isso. O Nostr é algo moldável, você consegue fazer dele o que quiser, e por aqui você vai encontrar muitas dessas pessoas que o moldam (idealizadores, programadores e desenvolvedores).\n\n## **Cuide de sua NSEC**\n\nSua Nsec é a chave privada para acesso ao seu perfil, quem a possuir poderá realizar qualquer alteração que queira, comentar, publicar posts e assim por diante. Você deve guardar essa Nsec como se fosse a seed phrase ou chave privada de sua carteira cripto.\n\nExistem alguns modos de guardar e criptografar sua Nsec:\n\n### Sem Criptografia\n\n***Primeiro de tudo, fique ciente de onde está a sua nsec no client em que acessa o Nostr!***\n\nNo Amethyst\n\n- Abra o menu de opções\n- Selecione \"Copia de segurança\"\n- Clique em \"copiar minha chave secreta\" Sua nsec será copiada para a àrea de transferência de seu teclado.\n\nDepois de copiar sua nsec, as melhores recomendações que tenho para passar são:\n\n### 1. Amber\n\nGuarde sua nsec no #Amber, um app assinador de eventos que guarda sua nsec sob criptografia. Após isso, use o mesmo para acessar qualquer client ou site e gerenciar as permissões de cada um. nostr:nevent1qqsvppyfxm87uegv9fpw56akm8e8jlaksxhc6vvlu5s3cmkmz9e0x8cpypmhxue69uhkummnw3ezuampd3kx2ar0veekzar0wd5xjtnrdakj7q3q5wnjy9pfx5xm9w2mjqezyhdgthw3ty4ydmnnamtmhvfmzl9x8cssxpqqqqqqztzjvrd\n\n### 2. Nos2x-fox\n\nColoque sua nsec no #Nos2x-fox, um gerenciador de permissões para navegadores a partir do #Firefox. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nos2x-fox/ E para navegadores da base #chromium existe o #Nos2x do mesmo desenvolvedor. https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nos2x/kpgefcfmnafjgpblomihpgmejjdanjjp\n\n### 3. Gerenciador de Senhas\n\nEssa é a recomendação mais arriscada, você ainda terá de usar o copiar e colar de sua nsec para acessar o Nostr, a não ser que seu gerenciador reconheça o campo de preenchimento da nsec. Mesmo assim, existem dois gerenciadores que indico; o #Bitwarden e #KeePassDX:\n\n#### Bitwarden (online)\n\nPlay Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden Github: https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile\n\n#### KeePassDX (offline)\n\nPlay Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kunzisoft.keepass.free Github: https://github.com/Kunzisoft/KeePassDX\n\n### Com Criptografia\n\nSe tiver interesse em criptografar sua chave, o formato nativo aceito pelos clients é o ncryptsec. O #ncryptsec é uma criptografia por senha (a grosso modo), onde para ser capaz de usá-la nos clients, somente em conjunto com a senha usada na criptografia, fora isso, você não tem acesso. Você consegue encriptar sua nsec e hex para ncryptsec por meios como os abaixo:\n\n### 1. Amethyst (nsec)\n\nExiste uma função nativa no Amethyst abaixo da opção \"copiar chave secreta\" onde é só adicionar a sua senha e será criada uma ncryptsec para copiar. Guarde essa nsec encriptada + senha de descriptação em um lugar seguro.\n\n### 2. Amber (nsec)\n\nNo Amber, existe uma função capaz de encriptar sua nsec.\n\nAo entrar no Amber\n\n- Selecione a engrenagem na parte inferior da tela\n- Selecione \"backup keys\"\n- E rolando para baixo existe um campo para digitar sua senha para encriptação da nsec, digite sua senha e copie a ncryptsec. Guarde-as em um lugar seguro.\n\n### 3. Nostr-Tools (hex)\n\nFoi-me dito que essa ferramenta também encripta o formato nsec, mas eu não consegui fazê-lo, então deixarei para o formato hex. Compile essa ferramenta em seu pc e siga as instruções. Sua chave Hex será encriptada. https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools/blob/master/nip49.ts Guarde-as em um lugar seguro.\n\n## **Relays e Servidores**\n\n### Relays\n\nOs #Relays (ou relés) são essenciais para receber e enviar informações no Nostr, veja abaixo algumas definições e como utilizar: nostr:nevent1qqsw85k097m8rh5cgqm8glndhnv8lqsm3ajywgkp04mju9je3xje3hcpzemhxue69uhkummnw3ezuerpw3sju6rpw4ej7q3qne99yarta29qxnsp0ssp6cpnnqmtwl8cvklenfcsg2fantuvf0zqxpqqqqqqzxvc0le No exemplo é usado o Orbot no Amethyst, você pode escolher usar essa opção, mas houve uma atualização do Amethyst desde a criação deste post, onde foi adicionada a função de \"Tor interno\".\n\nNo Amethyst\n\n- Deslize a tela da esquerda pra direita\n- Selecione \"Opções de Privacidade\"\n- Na opção \"Motor Tor Ativo\" selecione \"Interno\"\n- Para melhor privacidade, na opção \"Predefinições Tor/Privacidade\" selecione \"Privacidade Completa\" Todo conteúdo e informação que receber do Nostr passará através da rede Tor, além de que é possível visualizar conteúdos publicados no Nostr exclusivos da rede #Tor com essa configuração. Lembrando que este método é mais veloz que usar o Orbot.\n\nAqui estão alguns relays Tor: nostr:nevent1qqsqe96a8630tdmcsh759ct8grfsdh0ckma8juamc97c53xvura3etqpxpmhxue69uhhyetvv9ujumn0wd68ytnzv9hxgtmhwden5te0vdhkyunpve6k6cfwvdhk6tmjv4kxz7gzyr604d4k2mwrx5gaywlcjqjdevtkvtdjq4hmtzswjxjhf6zv2p23qqcyqqqqqqgmxr5jk\n\n### Servidores de Mídia\n\nOs servidores de mídia são os responsáveis por armazenar seus vídeos e fotos postados no Nostr. No Amethyst já existem alguns por padrão: https://image.nostr.build/8e75323bb428c1e5ef06e37453f56bc3deecd38492a593174c7d141cac1c2677.jpg Mas se você quiser, pode adicionar mais: nostr:nevent1qqster6rm55vy3geqauzzwrm50xwvs2gwa4l27ta2tc65xhpum2pfzcpzamhxue69uhkjmnzdauzuct60fsk6mewdejhgtczyr604d4k2mwrx5gaywlcjqjdevtkvtdjq4hmtzswjxjhf6zv2p23qqcyqqqqqqgv2za2r Fique atento aos limites e regras de cada servidor de mídia. nostr:nevent1qqsq3qchucw49wfu2c4wpsung93ffzg4ktt4uuygnjcs5pldf5alr9c3hsgjr\n\nE aqui vai uma #curiosidade: Caso queira postar uma foto ou vídeo que já postou antes, copie o ID da nota em que ela está e cole no novo post, ou então o URL da mídia. Você pode perceber que após upar uma mídia no Nostr, isso se torna uma URL, sempre que usar essa mesma URL, essa mídia irá aparecer.\n\n## **Lightning e Zaps**\n\nSe você chegou aqui por meio de bitcoinheiros, já deve saber que por aqui, usamos a #Lightning para enviar zaps. Mas o que são zaps?\n\nZaps são nada mais do que satoshis enviados no Nostr. Um exemplo, eu criei esse artigo, pessoas que querem me apoiar ou agradecer por tal, me enviam alguma quantia em sats, dizemos que essa pessoa me mandou um #zap.\n\nAgora posso falar mais sobre a lightning no Nostr.\n\nPara enviar zaps para usuários no Nostr, você precisa de uma carteira lightning. E a carteira que recomendo criarem para isso é através da #Coinos. Na Coinos, você não precisa criar carteiras com seed phrases nem canais lightning, ela é uma carteira custodial, ou seja, a seed phrase está de posse da Coinos. Basta você acessar [coinos.io](coinos.io) e criar uma conta com username e senha, você pode configurar um e-mail de resgate, código 2FA, e senha para movimentação de fundos. Se quiser, aqui está o app da Coinos, ainda em fase de testes, mas a maior parte do usual funciona perfeitamente. nostr:nevent1qqspndmkhq2dpfjs5tv7mezz57fqrkmlklp4wrn3vlma93cr57q5xlqpypmhxue69uhkummnw3ezuampd3kx2ar0veekzar0wd5xjtnrdakj7q3q7xzhreevjvzyvuy48mjn7qlx55q2dktk3xm0lnlpehxvl8dq3l6qxpqqqqqqzp4vkne (o app está disponível na #zapstore, baixe a loja para ter acesso) O legal da coinos é que você pode criar um endereço lightning com o nome que você escolher, o meu por exemplo é componente08@coinos.io, basta criar sua conta e poderá enviar e receber zaps no mesmo instante.\n\nMas para receber de fato um zap usando o Nostr, você precisa configurar seu endereço lightning no seu perfil. Crie sua conta e copie seu endereço lightning.\n\nNo Amethyst\n\n- Clique na sua imagem de perfil\n- Selecione \"Perfil\"\n- Aperte o botão com um lápis\n- Em \"Endereço LN\" e \"LN URL\" cole seu endereço lightning Pronto! Agora as pessoas podem te enviar zaps através de suas publicações.\n\nAntes de enviar zaps, configure seus valores no client.\n\nNo Amethyst\n\n- Aperte e segure no raio de qualquer publicação\n- No campo \"novo valor em sats\" digite um valor desejado\n- Aperte o \"x\" nos valores que deseja excluir\n- Clique em \"Salvar\"\n\nAgora, você pode clicar no raio e escolher um valor, ao escolher você será direcionado para a sua carteira, confirme a transação e seu zap foi realizado!\n\nExiste outro meio de enviar zaps que é através do #NWC (Nostr Wallet Connect). Siga os mesmos passos do Yakihonne no Amethyst na aba do raio que acessamos anteriormente. nostr:nevent1qqsxrkufrhpxpfe9yty90s8dnal89qz39zrv78ugmg5z2qvyteckfkqpzamhxue69uhkjmnzdauzuct60fsk6mewdejhgtczyr604d4k2mwrx5gaywlcjqjdevtkvtdjq4hmtzswjxjhf6zv2p23qqcyqqqqqqgrw73ux O NWC dá ao client ou app, a permissão de gerenciar sua carteira. Isso te permite enviar zaps sem sair do client ou precisar entrar no app da carteira.\n\nExistem muitas outras carteiras lightning por aí, então além da coinos, deixarei o link de outras duas que utilizo.\n\n### WOS (Wallet of Satoshi)\n\nSomente Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.livingroomofsatoshi.wallet\n\n### Minibits\n\nPlay Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minibits_wallet Github: https://github.com/minibits-cash/minibits_wallet\n\n## **Comunidades**\n\nEm uma #comunidade é possível encontrar respostas para suas perguntas, artigos e postagens de seu interesse, links úteis e tutoriais para burlar sistemas, documentos e estudos sem censura, etc. Aqui está um exemplo: nostr:nevent1qqs8qztlq26hhstz9yz2tn02gglzdvl5xhkpzhnpuh8v65mjldtdjlqpzamhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuvrcvd5xzapwvdhk6tczypr5gcpycla5zerha52xlam9427xdcf8dm4jccxxqk28gzayt8l4kqcyqqqqqqgldlvdq Esse usuário recorrentemente atualiza a lista de comunidades brasileiras no Nostr, recomendo seguir o perfil para se manter atualizado caso tenha interesse: nostr:nevent1qqsxkusgt02pmz6mda4emjlnjjyd4y9pa73ux02dcry8vk3wp85aq9cpzamhxue69uhkjmnzdauzuct60fsk6mewdejhgtczypr5gcpycla5zerha52xlam9427xdcf8dm4jccxxqk28gzayt8l4kqcyqqqqqqgqq5zn5 Aqui vão algumas #curiosidades para usuários mais avançados: nostr:nevent1qqs246x86gw4zfp70wg65rjklf909n6nppwm0xx6mssl6jgznw4nkjcpzamhxue69uhkjmnzdauzuct60fsk6mewdejhgtczyzgmafwdjds4qnzqn2h5t9gknz8k3ghu6jp8vt7edxnum3ca73z3cqcyqqqqqqgtkt83q Existem alguns clients que podem criar e gerenciar comunidades, caso você não encontrou nada de seu interesse e quer criar uma, os mais populares são:\n\n[Satellite.earth](satellite.earth) e [noStrudel.ninja](nostrudel.ninja)\n\n## **Chats**\n\nOs #chats são espaços voltados a interação por meio de mensagens, aqui estão alguns: nostr:nevent1qqs98kldepjmlxngupsyth40n0h5lw7z5ut5w4scvh27alc0w86tevcpr4mhxue69uhkummnw3ezucnfw33k76twv4ezuum0vd5kzmp0qgsfujjjw3474zsrfcqhcgqavqeesd4h0nuxt0ue5ugy9y7e47xyh3qrqsqqqqqpgdaghw Para contatar uma pessoa no privado:\n\nNo Amethyst\n\n- Clique no perfil da pessoa\n- Clique no ícone de mensagem\n- Envie uma mensagem\n\nCaso queira criar um chat, siga os passos:\n\nNo Amethyst\n\n- Clique no ícone de mensagens\n- Clique no ícone de \"+\"\n- Serão exibidas duas opções; \"privado\" e \"público\", escolha privado para um grupo de poucas pessoas e público para qualquer que quiser entrar.\n- Adicione as especificações necessárias e seu chat será criado.\n\n## **Seguidores**\n\nExiste uma #ferramenta capaz de identificar quais usuários que você segue estão inativos, ou publicam pouco e a longos hiatos: nostr:nevent1qqsqqqyhmkqz6x5yrsctcufxhsseh3vtku26thawl68z7klwvcyqyzcpzamhxue69uhkjmnzdauzuct60fsk6mewdejhgtczyzgmafwdjds4qnzqn2h5t9gknz8k3ghu6jp8vt7edxnum3ca73z3cqcyqqqqqqgmfzr67\n\n## **Mais do Nostr**\n\nExistem muitas outras coisas para se explorar no Nostr, e é possível que daqui a uns meses, essas configurações e dicas estejam obsoletas. Explorem e aprendam mais sobre esse protocolo.\n\nAbaixo estão mais algumas coisas que gostaria de compartilhar:\n\nMuitos clients não possuem um sistema de #notificações, isso por conta da natureza #descentralizada dos apps, e para não ceder ao Google para isso, optaram por não ter notificações. O Amethyst por exemplo, só possui notificações ativas para quando você receber zaps.

This post is meant as a short overview.\n\n## Regular relays have challenges\n\nCurrent relay software have significant challenges, which I have experienced when hosting Nostr.land:\n- Scalability is only supported by adding full replicas, which does not scale to large relays.\n- Most relays use slow databases and are not optimized for large scale usage.\n- Search is near-impossible to implement on standard relays.\n- Privacy features such as NIP-42 are lacking.\n- Regular DB maintenance tasks on normal relays require extended downtime.\n- Fault-tolerance is implemented, if any, using a load balancer, which is limited.\n- Personalization and advanced filtering is not possible.\n- Local caching is not supported.\n\n## NFDB: A scalable database for large relays\n\nNFDB is a new database meant for medium-large scale relays, built on [FoundationDB](https://foundationdb.org) that provides:\n- Near-unlimited scalability\n- Extended fault tolerance\n- Instant loading\n- Better search\n- Better personalization\n- and more.\n\n### Search\n\nNFDB has extended search capabilities including:\n- Semantic search: Search for meaning, not words.\n- Interest-based search: Highlight content *you* care about.\n- Multi-faceted queries: Easily filter by topic, author group, keywords, and more at the same time.\n- Wide support for event kinds, including users, articles, etc.\n\n### Personalization\n\nNFDB allows significant personalization:\n- Customized algorithms: Be your own algorithm.\n- Spam filtering: Filter content to your WoT, and use advanced spam filters.\n- Topic mutes: Mute topics, not keywords.\n- Media filtering: With Nostr.build, you will be able to filter NSFW and other content\n- Low data mode: Block notes that use high amounts of cellular data.\n- and more\n\n### Other\n\nNFDB has support for many other features such as:\n- NIP-42: Protect your privacy with private drafts and DMs\n- Microrelays: Easily deploy your own personal microrelay\n- Containers: Dedicated, fast storage for discoverability events such as relay lists\n\n## Calcite: A local microrelay database\n\nCalcite is a lightweight, local version of NFDB that is meant for microrelays and caching, meant for __thousands__ of personal microrelays.\n\nCalcite HA is an additional layer that allows live migration and relay failover in under 30 seconds, providing higher availability compared to current relays with greater simplicity. Calcite HA is enabled in all Calcite deployments.\n\nFor zero-downtime, NFDB is recommended.\n\n## Noswhere SmartCache\n\nRelays are fixed in one location, but users can be anywhere.\n\nNoswhere SmartCache is a *CDN for relays* that dynamically caches data on edge servers closest to you, allowing:\n- Multiple regions around the world\n- Improved throughput and performance\n- Faster loading times\n\n## routerd\n\n`routerd` is a custom load-balancer optimized for Nostr relays, integrated with SmartCache.\n\n`routerd` is specifically integrated with NFDB and Calcite HA to provide fast failover and high performance.\n\n## Ending notes\n\nNFDB is planned to be deployed to Nostr.land in the coming weeks.\n\nA lot more is to come. 👀️️️️️️","sig":"a150b5570bcdc79f644668f93446128a685fd66d54eb9f584eb2575d28260d84412d5a56c700c439099795ab0410f438c9ade91dccd026acfe18c072d302456a"},"naddr1qqxnqvfjxqer2tfh0fekz7r5qyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qc8n9qhqzm2x3kzjm84kmdcvm96ezmn257r5xxphv3gsnjq4nz4lqxpqqqp65w087e3w":{"kind":30023,"id":"c9053808c392c25f84e0bb5d904cbd6e24e7763d68c31c3ecf504ea4427949b4","pubkey":"c1e6505c02da8d1b0a5b3d6db6e19b2eb22dcd54f0e86306ec8a213902b3157e","created_at":1737402245,"tags":[["title","012025"],["image","https://nostr.download/2410964878fbd8ba582695a0045b7f086b3695d9abb1ead24a1aa5d81ec6133e.jpeg"],["summary","Light, Seasons, and the Art of Meandering"],["t","photography"],["t","nostr"],["t","v4v"],["t","landscape"],["published_at","1737402245"],["d","012025-7zsaxt"],["client","highlighter","31990:73c6bb92440a9344279f7a36aa3de1710c9198b1e9e8a394cd13e0dd5c994c63:1704502265408"]],"content":"There’s a tension between nature’s rhythms and human ambition, especially in winter. As Earth meanders to its furthest point from the sun, our social and economic engines paradoxically accelerate - driven by holidays, deadlines, and the relentless pursuit of being productive. Yet nature offers a contrasting wisdom in its deliberate deceleration, encouraging us to slow down and reflect. ![](https://nostr.download/57be798b37b3cffd762a2933d6369d273a568bca0d0a9e581f8be7fc60fba971.jpeg) Seasonal cycles are not arbitrary patterns but interconnected signals within a web of biological, environmental, and economic systems. \\*Their foundation lies in light itself — the building block of existence, essentially matter in a slowed-down state. This act of deceleration doesn’t just create physical substance; it provides structure, clarity, and form.\\* Meandering through these seasonal changes isn’t a passive drift - it’s an opportunity to realign. Slowing down, like nature does, creates space to step back from the busyness of society and technology. It allows us to reflect on where we are, re-ground ourselves, and act with greater intention. In this pause, we rediscover the creative power of slowness: the ability to lay foundations, see clearly, and prepare for growth when the time is right.

Though focused on social media, his concept provided a blueprint for decentralized content systems writ large. The [PROMO Protocol](https://github.com/joinnextblock/promo-protocol), designed by NextBlock while participating in [Sovereign Engineering](https://sovereignengineering.io/), embodies this blueprint in the realm of advertising, leveraging Nostr and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to give individuals control, foster a multi-provider ecosystem, and ensure secure value exchange. In this way, Ulbricht’s 2021 vision can be seen as a prescient prediction of the PROMO Protocol’s structure. This is a testament to the enduring power of his ideas, now finding form in NextBlock’s innovative approach.\n\n![Current Platform-Centric Paradigm](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*CB0QrPo6rq66HEXDLkbdbA.jpeg)\n[Current Platform-Centric Paradigm, source: Ross Ulbricht's Decentralize Social Media]\n\n## **Ulbricht’s Vision: A Decentralized Social Protocol**\n\nIn his 2021 Medium article Ulbricht proposed a revolutionary vision for a decentralized social protocol (DSP) to address the inherent flaws of centralized social media platforms, such as privacy violations and inconsistent content moderation. Writing from prison, Ulbricht argued that decentralization could empower users by giving them control over their own content and the value they create, while replacing single, monolithic platforms with a competitive ecosystem of interface providers, content servers, and advertisers. Though his focus was on social media, Ulbricht’s ideas laid a conceptual foundation that strikingly predicts the structure of NextBlock’s PROMO Protocol, a decentralized advertising system built on the Nostr protocol.\n\n![A Decentralized Social Protocol (DSP)](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*fkcGmP_C8eUXcZWla_hfaw.jpeg)\n[A Decentralized Social Protocol (DSP), source: Ross Ulbricht's Decentralize Social Media]\n\n## **Ulbricht’s Principles**\n\nUlbricht’s article outlines several key principles for his DSP:\n* User Control: Users should own their content and dictate how their data and creations generate value, rather than being subject to the whims of centralized corporations.\n* Decentralized Infrastructure: Instead of a single platform, multiple interface providers, content hosts, and advertisers interoperate, fostering competition and resilience.\n* Privacy and Autonomy: Decentralized solutions for profile management, hosting, and interactions would protect user privacy and reduce reliance on unaccountable intermediaries.\n* Value Creation: Users, not platforms, should capture the economic benefits of their contributions, supported by decentralized mechanisms for transactions.\n\nThese ideas were forward-thinking in 2021, envisioning a shift away from the centralized giants dominating social media at the time. While Ulbricht didn’t specifically address advertising protocols, his framework for decentralization and user empowerment extends naturally to other domains, like NextBlock’s open-source offering: the [PROMO Protocol](https://github.com/joinnextblock/promo-protocol).\n\n## **NextBlock’s Implementation of PROMO Protocol**\n\nThe [PROMO Protocol](https://github.com/joinnextblock/promo-protocol) powers NextBlock's Billboard app, a decentralized advertising protocol built on Nostr, a simple, open protocol for decentralized communication. The PROMO Protocol reimagines advertising by:\n* Empowering People: Individuals set their own ad prices (e.g., 500 sats/minute), giving them direct control over how their attention or space is monetized.\n* Marketplace Dynamics: Advertisers set budgets and maximum bids, competing within a decentralized system where a 20% service fee ensures operational sustainability.\n* Open-Source Flexibility: As an open-source protocol, it allows multiple developers to create interfaces or apps on top of it, avoiding the single-platform bottleneck Ulbricht critiqued.\n* Secure Payments: Using Strike Integration with Bitcoin Lightning Network, NextBlock enables bot-resistant and intermediary-free transactions, aligning value transfer with each person's control.\n\nThis structure decentralizes advertising in a way that mirrors Ulbricht’s broader vision for social systems, with aligned principles showing a specific use case: monetizing attention on Nostr.\n\n## **Aligned Principles**\n\nUlbricht’s 2021 article didn’t explicitly predict the [PROMO Protocol](https://github.com/joinnextblock/promo-protocol), but its foundational concepts align remarkably well with NextBlock's implementation the protocol’s design:\n* Autonomy Over Value: Ulbricht argued that users should control their content and its economic benefits. In the PROMO Protocol, people dictate ad pricing, directly capturing the value of their participation. Whether it’s their time, influence, or digital space, rather than ceding it to a centralized ad network.\n* Ecosystem of Providers: Ulbricht envisioned multiple providers replacing a single platform. The PROMO Protocol’s open-source nature invites a similar diversity: anyone can build interfaces or tools on top of it, creating a competitive, decentralized advertising ecosystem rather than a walled garden.\n* Decentralized Transactions: Ulbricht’s DSP implied decentralized mechanisms for value exchange. NextBlock delivers this through the Bitcoin Lightning Network, ensuring that payments for ads are secure, instantaneous and final, a practical realization of Ulbricht’s call for user-controlled value flows.\n* Privacy and Control: While Ulbricht emphasized privacy in social interactions, the PROMO Protocol is public by default. Individuals are fully aware of all data that they generate since all Nostr messages are signed.  All participants interact directly via Nostr.\n\n![Blueprint Match](https://image.nostr.build/56af54939e98462fc28987a373c0eae90cd951c07a44b70a6324b470276674e1.jpg)\n[Blueprint Match, source NextBlock]\n\n---\n## Who We Are\n\nNextBlock is a US-based new media company reimagining digital ads for a decentralized future.

Exciting stuff in this update so no intro, let's get straight into it.\n\n## 🚢 Libraries Released\n\nI've created 4 new Rust crates to make implementing NIP-EE (MLS) messaging easy for other projects. These are now part of the [rust-nostr](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr) project (thanks nostr:npub1drvpzev3syqt0kjrls50050uzf25gehpz9vgdw08hvex7e0vgfeq0eseet) but aren't quite released to crates.io yet. They will be included in the next release of that library. My hope is that these libraries will give nostr developers a simple, safe, and specification-compliant way to work with MLS messaging in their applications.\n\nHere's a quick overview of each:\n\n### nostr_mls_storage\n\nOne of the challenges of using MLS messaging is that clients have to store quite a lot of state about groups, keys, and messages. Initially, I implemented all of this in White Noise but knew that eventually this would need to be done in a more generalized way.\n\nThis crate defines traits and types that are used by the storage implementation crates and sets those up to wrap the OpenMLS storage layer. Now, instead of apps having to implement storage for both OpenMLS and Nostr, you simply pick your storage backend and go from there.\n\nImportantly, because these are generic traits, it allows for the creation of any number of storage implementations for different backend storage providers; postgres, lmdb, nostrdb, etc. To start I've created two implementations; detailed below.\n\n### nostr_mls_memory_storage\n\nThis is a simple implementation of the nostr_mls_storage traits that uses an in-memory store (that doesn't persist anything to disc). This is principally for testing.\n\n### nostr_mls_sqlite_storage\n\nThis is a production ready implementation of the nostr_mls_storage traits that uses a persistent local sqlite database to store all data.\n\n### nostr_mls\n\nThis is the main library that app developers will interact with. Once you've chose a backend and instantiated an instance of NostrMls you can then interact with a simple set of methods to create key packages, create groups, send messages, process welcomes and messages, and more.\n\nIf you want to see a complete example of what the interface looks like check out [mls_memory.rs](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr/blob/master/crates/nostr-mls/examples/mls_memory.rs).\n\nI'll continue to add to this library over time as I implement more of the MLS protocol features.\n\n## 🚧 White Noise Refactor\n\nAs a result of these new libraries, I was able to remove a huge amount of code from White Noise and refactor large parts of the app to make the codebase easier to understand and maintain. Because of this large refactor and the changes in the underlying storage layer, if you've installed White Noise before you'll need to delete it from your device before you trying to install again.\n\n## 🖼️ Encrypted Media with Blossom\n\nLet's be honest: Group chat would be basically useless if you couldn't share memes and gifs. Well, now you can in White Noise. Media in groups is encrypted using an MLS secret and uploaded to Blossom with a one-time use keypair. This gives groups a way to have rich conversations with images and documents and anything else while also maintaining the privacy and security of the conversation.\n\nThis is still in a rough state but rendering improvements are coming next.\n\n## 📱 Damn Mobile\n\nThe app is still in a semi-broken state on Android and fully broken state on iOS. Now that I have the libraries released and the White Noise core code refactored, I'm focused 100% on fixing these issues. My goal is to have a beta version live on Zapstore in a few weeks.\n\n## 🧑‍💻 Join Us\n\nI'm looking for mobile developers on both Android and iOS to join the team and help us build the best possible apps for these platforms. I have grant funding available for the right people. Come and help us build secure, permissionless, censorship-resistant messaging. I can think of few projects that deserve your attention more than securing freedom of speech and freedom of association for the entire world. If you're interested or know someone who might be, please reach out to me directly.\n\n## 🙏 Thanks to the People\n\nLast but not least: A HUGE thank you to all the folks that have been helping make this project happen. You can check out the people that are directly working on the apps on [Following._](https://following.space/d/kvbtsfq1jbc8) (and follow them). There are also a lot of people behind the scenes that have helped in myriad ways to get us this far.

Introduction \u003ca name=\"introduction\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe Nostr ecosystem has emerged as a powerful decentralized alternative to traditional social media networks, particularly as a potential disruptor of Twitter and other centralized—and even existing decentralized—social media platforms. Developed using a protocol based on cryptographic key pairs and a multi-relay system, Nostr is unique in its provision of censorship resistance and user sovereignty. In this report, we provide a detailed analysis of the current state, scalability challenges, and market disruption potential of Nostr, followed by speculative insights on its trajectory over the next five years.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Overview of the Nostr Ecosystem \u003ca name=\"overview\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nLaunched in 2022, Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) has rapidly gained traction as an open and decentralized social network. Some of the core features include:\n\n- **Decentralized Communication:** Relying on independent relays across multiple countries and autonomous systems, Nostr offers an architecture that ensures posts are not stored on a single centralized server.\n- **Censorship Resistance:** With cryptographic authentication and a decentralized relay structure, content censorship becomes significantly more difficult than in traditional networks.\n- **User Sovereignty:** Empowering users with cryptographic key pairs allows for enhanced privacy and data ownership.\n- **Wide Geographic Distribution:** The ecosystem spreads over 44 countries and 151 autonomous systems, underscoring its global reach.\n\nNotable endorsements from figures such as Jack Dorsey, Edward Snowden, Vitalik Buterin, and Sen. Cynthia Lummis have bolstered its reputation as an experimental yet promising alternative to centralized social platforms.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Current Use Cases and Quantitative Metrics \u003ca name=\"use-cases\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n### User Adoption Metrics \u003ca name=\"user-adoption\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n- **User Base:** In just two years, the Nostr network has attracted over 4 million users, a significant figure given its nascent stage and decentralized nature.\n- **Content Generation:** With over 60 million posts, the volume of content mirrors the rapid adoption and active usage seen in more centralized models.\n- **Post Replication:** Empirical measurements indicate that there are 17.8 million text notes among these posts, replicated on an average of 34.6 relays per post. This level of replication underlines robust resilience and availability even if significant portions of the network experience downtime.\n\n### Network Resilience and Decentralization \u003ca name=\"network-resilience\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n- **Global Distribution:** Nostr’s decentralized network ensures high availability with \u003e90% post accessibility even under simulated network failures (e.g., removal of key relays or autonomous systems).\n- **Robustness:** The dispersion across 712 relays illustrates that decentralization is not only a design choice but also a working reality, which contributes to the network’s reliability.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Operational Challenges and Scalability \u003ca name=\"challenges\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhile the Nostr ecosystem demonstrates significant promise, it faces noteworthy operational challenges.\n\n### Replication Overhead and Bandwidth Issues \u003ca name=\"replication-overhead\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n- **Excessive Redundancy:** Detailed studies have shown that nearly 98.2% of retrieval traffic is redundant. In practice, this equates to an estimated 144 TiB of unnecessary bandwidth consumption.\n- **Optimization Proposals:** To mitigate these inefficiencies, there's a proposal to limit post replications from 34.6 relays to between 10 and 20 relays per post. This could reduce redundant data copies by between 380 million to 480 million instances, potentially lowering operational costs and improving bandwidth utilization.\n- **Scaling Concerns:** With a projected network load of 10 million events per day (or approximately 2 TB annually), the throughput requirement of ~115 TPS is putting a strain on the current architecture. This has led to debates on whether solutions like the current outbox mechanism are sufficient or if further fundamental redesigns and emergent moderation systems are needed.\n\n### Relay Downtime and Financial Sustainability \u003ca name=\"relay-downtime\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n- **Relay Stability:** Data indicates roughly 20% of relays suffer from significant downtime (exceeding 40% operational time), and 132 relays have been classified as 'dead'. This is a concern for maintaining network integrity.\n- **Economic Model Challenges:** With 95% of free-to-use relays unable to cover operational costs due to minimal zap-based income, there is an urgent need for innovative monetization or community funding models to ensure long-term sustainability.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Market Disruption and Sentiment \u003ca name=\"disruption\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nNostr is positioned as both a disruptor to traditional centralized social platforms—most notably Twitter—and a catalyst for change within decentralized social media.\n\n### Disrupting Twitter and Centralized Platforms \u003ca name=\"twitter-disruption\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n- **User Shift:** While Twitter remains the most well-known platform, the high-profile endorsements and robust user base of Nostr indicate that there is both market intrigue and a gradual shift among early adopters. Disruption here is measured not only in user numbers but also in the paradigm shift towards decentralized content distribution.\n- **Market Penetration:** Current metrics (4 million users, 60 million posts) suggest that Nostr is challenging Twitter's centralized model insofar as it appeals to users prioritizing censorship resistance, data sovereignty, and resiliency against centralized failures. However, mainstream adoption on par with Twitter is still not realized, and there remains a gap in user experience and feature richness.\n\n### Impact on Decentralized Social Media and Censorship Resistance \u003ca name=\"decentralized-social-media\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n- **Complementary Integrations:** As decentralized social media ecosystems continue to mature, integration between Nostr and other censorship-resistant platforms is increasingly likely. This can include interoperability protocols, shared identity management systems, and cross-platform content replication.\n- **Comparative Advantage:** Nostr's network design offers unique advantages over other decentralized social media, particularly in its straightforward, relay-based communication protocol. This positions Nostr to potentially serve as an underpinning technology for a broader decoherent ecosystem of social networks.\n- **Sentiment Toward Scalability Innovations:** Discussions around scaling Nostr often focus on the balance between ensuring redundancy (for resilience) and reducing overhead (for efficiency). The sentiment is one of cautious optimism: while outbox solutions offer a stopgap, many experts advocate for more fundamental architectural redesigns in the long-term.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Future Trends and 5-Year Outlook \u003ca name=\"future-outlook\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nLooking forward, the evolution of Nostr will likely be shaped by several interrelated trends and emerging technical innovations.\n\n### Innovative Protocol Developments \u003ca name=\"protocol-innovations\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n- **Decentralized Identity and Reputation Mechanisms:** The next phase may see the introduction of distributed reputation systems and rating mechanisms that aid in spam management and improve trustworthiness without compromising decentralization.\n- **Optimistic Replication and Selective Mirroring:** Innovations such as selective content mirroring and event pruning will be key in managing bandwidth and storage demands while remaining true to the decentralized philosophy.\n\n### Quantitative Forecasting and Diffusion Modeling \u003ca name=\"forecasting\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n- **Forecast Models:** By integrating modified Bass diffusion models and learning curve effects, predictions suggest that Nostr can potentially spur significant market disruption within five years. Recent studies indicate that forecasting models in disruptive technology fields have reached accuracies of up to 82% for demand projections.\n- **Hybrid Quantitative Techniques:** Leveraging methods like LDA2Vec and patent citation network analysis, combined with multi-criteria decision-making models (as seen in extended UTAUT approaches), will be crucial for accurately estimating future adoption and cost efficiencies.\n- **Metrics to Monitor:** Future research should focus on user growth rates, relay uptime percentages, cost reductions achieved through replication optimizations, and overall sentiment analysis using advanced deep learning architectures that overcome traditional pitfalls (e.g., sarcasm and multipolarity in text data).\n\n### Networking and Integration with Emerging Technologies \u003ca name=\"networking-integration\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n- **Integration with Other Decentralized Platforms:** One promising avenue is exploring cross-platform interoperability with other decentralized and blockchain-based social networks, which could lead to a more cohesive ecosystem. This would not only enhance user experience but also enable shared security and moderation frameworks.\n- **Next-Generation Relays:** The deployment of relays that are more resilient through redundancy optimization and financial sustainability models (perhaps incorporating micro-transaction revenue models or community-driven funding) is another critical area. Such improvements could mitigate the issues of relay downtime and excessive network overhead.\n- **Contrarian Approaches:** A contrarian perspective suggests that instead of building on current frameworks, a radical overhaul of the network architecture might be considered, potentially by leveraging novel distributed ledger technologies or leveraging a hybrid centralized-decentralized model during the transition phase to ensure smoother scaling.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclusions and Strategic Recommendations \u003ca name=\"conclusions\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe Nostr ecosystem represents a significant stride toward decentralized, censorship-resistant social media. While its current market adoption and technical design offer a robust alternative to centralized platforms like Twitter, several challenges must be addressed for sustained growth and disruption:\n\n1. **Optimization of Data Replication:** Reducing redundant data transfers without compromising resilience is essential. Limiting the replication factor and exploring optimistic retrieval mechanisms could provide a balance between availability and efficiency.\n\n2. **Relay Stability and Sustainability:** With nearly 20% of relays experiencing significant downtime, innovative financial and technical models (such as micro-payments and community funding) should be deployed to enhance the operational reliability of network nodes.\n\n3. **Enhanced Moderation and Reputation Systems:** Emerging strategies for decentralized content moderation and reputation management could reduce spam and improve content quality while preserving the open nature of the network.\n\n4. **Interoperability with Other Decentralized Platforms:** Fostering integration with other emerging systems could accelerate market disruption across the broader spectrum of social media.\n\n5. **Future-Proofing Through Quantitative Forecasting:** Continual adoption of cutting-edge forecasting models and machine learning techniques to measure sentiment and track network metrics is imperative for proactive evolution.\n\n6. **Exploring Contrarian Innovations:** In addition to incremental changes, it is important not to discount radically new architectures that may emerge from ongoing research in distributed systems and blockchain technologies.\n\n### Final Outlook\n\nIn the coming five years, Nostr has the potential to disrupt not only Twitter but also the broader landscape of both centralized and decentralized social media. Although the current architecture presents significant scaling challenges, proactive investments in replication optimization, relay stability, and cross-platform integration will likely propel the network into a more mature phase of adoption. The ecosystem will benefit from a dual approach that combines both evolutionary improvements and revolutionary changes, ensuring that it remains robust while meeting the demands of a growing, globally distributed user base.\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Appendix A: Data and Metrics Summary\n\n- **User Base:** ~4 million\n- **Post Volume:** \u003e60 million posts\n- **Average Relay Replication:** ~34.6 replicas per post\n- **Geographical Distribution:** 44 countries, 151 autonomous systems\n- **Bandwidth Waste:** ~144 TiB due to redundancy\n- **Network Load:** 10 million events/day (~2TB/year)\n- **Throughput Requirement:** ~115 TPS\n\n### Appendix B: Key Technical Proposals\n\n- **Replication Control:** Limit copies to 10–20 relays for optimal efficiency.\n- **Selective Mirroring:** Implement event pruning and selective content mirroring.\n- **Decentralized Reputation Systems:** Develop distributed rating mechanisms to enhance distributed moderation.\n\n### Appendix C: Forecasting and Quantitative Methods\n\n- **Diffusion Modeling:** Modified Bass models with multi-market dynamics.\n- **Hybrid Quantitative Techniques:** Integration of machine learning (CNN-LSTM, LDA2Vec) with multi‐criteria decision models.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Further Research\n\n- Investigate the comparative performance of alternative replication strategies in decentralized networks.\n- Explore funding models that can sustain relay operations without compromising neutrality or decentralization.\n- Conduct long-term sentiment analysis using advanced neural architectures to understand evolving user attitudes.\n- Evaluate the prospective benefits of radical design overhauls versus incremental enhancements in ensuring network scalability.\n\n---\n\n*This report is intended for expert analysts and researchers in decentralized network systems and social media disruption.

Nostr is SO much [more](https://hellonostr.xyz/tags/?tag=other) than just social media,\nbut that's where the bulk of the activity is, and is what I'm focusing on in this post. Even though the protocol is still so young, that has not prevented an explosion of excellent \n[social media](https://hellonostr.xyz/tags/?tag=social) focused clients that predominantly coalesce around the Twitter (X) style feed, containing shorter form content, often with images, and the ability to comment, \nlike and share.\n\nThis first steps guide showcases one of the most polished and simplest examples of such a client, [Primal](https://primal.net). Primal is a cross platform app, that also works on your computer too. The steps that follow are demonstrated on iPhone, but should be identical for Android users. There may be some topics of concepts here that are new to you, to learn more about them, check out our [Nostr 101](https://hellonostr.xyz/101) to learn more about Nostr basics and why it matters.\n\nYou can and should explore all of the other options available to you, that's the beauty of Nostr, you're free to choose how and where to interact with your social network. No lock in. No walled gardens. True freedom.\n\n![Primal Hero](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-hero.png)\n\n\n# Getting Started\n\n1. Go to your app store and download Primal to your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.primal.android) or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/primal/id1673134518)\n\n2. Open Primal and choose Create Account. Choose your public display name and add a short bio about yourself.\n\n![Getting Started](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-1.png)\n\n\n3. Select your chosen interests from the list provided. This will bootstrap your feed and auto-follow a number of accounts so that your feed is not completely empty when starting out.\n\n![Primal Hero](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-2.png)\n\n4. Review your account info and tap Create Account Now. Take note of the fact that 'Your Nostr Key is available in your Account Settings'. We'll revisit this shortly.\n\n![Account Preview](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-3.png)\n\n5. Next is an optional step of activating the wallet feature within Primal. Having a wallet within your social client enables you to send and receive value (known as 'Zaps') in the form of Bitcoin. On Facebook and Twitter you can like a post, but it means much more to send someone fractions of a penny (or more if you like) to show your appreciation for their insights. You'll need to provide some personal information to enable the wallet, including an email address.\n\n\u003e Using the internal wallet and purchasing sats with your credit card will tie your Nostr identity to your real ID. Think **very** carefully before carrying out this step. \u003cbr/\u003e Learn more in the detailed section at the end of this post.\n\n![Wallet Activation](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-4.png)\n\n\n6. That's it, you're now set up and ready to start sharing your thoughts, feelings and memes with the world via a decentralized and censorship resistant social network. To post your first\nnote and say hello to the Nostr world, tap the + in the bottom right corner.\n\n![Account Created](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-5.png)\n\n\n7. If you activated the wallet at step 5, you might want to deposit some Bitcoin in there to allow you to send some value to your friends. There are three main ways to do this:\n- Post some awesome content and have people send you value in the form of 'Zaps'\n- Send some Bitcoin from a wallet you already have\n- Purchase some directly within Primal\n\n\nThe latter is made very simple thanks to the in-app purchase feature, which allows you to purchase a small amount with the card you likely already have connected to your Apple/Google account. All you need to do is tap 'Buy Sats Now'. \n\n\n![First Bitcoin](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-6.png)\n\n\n8. Next, let's look at the different feeds available on our home screen. Tap 'Latest' at the top of the screen and you can toggle between three different types of home feeds, great for discovering new people and content.\n\n![Your Feeds](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-7.png)\n\n\n9. Let's assume you already have some friends on Nostr and want to find and follow them. Tap the search icon in the top right corner, the enter the name of the person you want to follow. \nOnce on their profile, simply tap the 'Follow' button.\n\n![Finding Someone](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-8.png)\n\n10. So you found a friend and want to start interacting with them so they know you made it over to Nostr. Simply find a note you like and choose from the different types of interactions available. From left to right they are:\n- **Comment**\n- **Zap** (send value from your wallet to theirs)\n- **Like**\n- **Repost**\n- **Bookmark**\n\n\n![Replying to a note](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-9.png)\n\nWhen Zapping, a single tap will send a tiny amount of 42 sats. If you want to send more, or a custom amount, tap and hold the zap button to bring up a selector menu. All default zap amounts are configurable in the app settings page.\n\n![Zapping a note](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-10.png)\n\n11. After you've started posting and interacting with others, you'll likely receive some notifications to tell you. Notifications can be filtered into interaction types.\n\n![Notifications](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-11.png)\n\n12. Another great way to find more people to follow and interact with is to use the discover page. To open it, tap the compass in the bottom right corner of the screen. Here you'll \nbe able to browse different types of pre-built feeds, trending profiles, notes with large zaps and extra topics.\n\n![Discovery](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-12.png)\n\n# The Important Part\n\nYou might have noticed that throughout that setup, you were not asked for a unique username, nor were you asked for a password. So how the hell is this secure? What happens if you log out? Is your account lost forever? \n\nThis is where Nostr really starts to shine. Just like in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, your Nostr account is protected by a 'Private Key'. Anyone with knowledge of the \nprivate key can access your account **in any Nostr client**. No private key, no access. So let's make sure you have a backup copy of it, so you can still recover access to your account in the event you lose your phone!\n\nTap on your profile image in the top left of the screen. Then tap Settings \u003e Keys. Here you'll see two keys, one public and one private.\nYour public key is how people find you on Nostr. It is often referred to by its more technical name 'nPub' which is the prefix if the key itself. Your public key is designed to be exactly that, public!\n\nYour private key is sometimes referred to by its technical name 'nSec' which is also the prefix of the key. Copy your private key and paste it somewhere safe and secure, in a location accessible independently from your phone, and only by you.\n\n\n![Discovery](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-13.png)\n\nIf you were to lose your phone, or accidentally delete the Primal app, now all you'd need to do is head back to step 1 above and choose Sign In. You'd then be asked to paste your private key, after which your profile and content would be magically restored. \n\n\u003e Your private key can be imported into any other Nostr social client for the same result.\n\n# Things to Consider\n\nThis post has one primary focus - To get you from zero to posting and zapping in the quickest time and with the least friction. To achieve this, there are some trade-offs made that you should be aware of.\n\n\n### Custodial Wallet\nThe built in wallet is a custodial one. This means that the funds within are ultimately controlled by the developers behind Primal. They may be good actors, but you should approach the amount of money you maintain inside this wallet accordingly. If your wallet balance ever gets to a balance that makes you uncomfortable, you should send a good chunk of it out to another Bitcoin wallet where you control the keys. I recommend [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) or [Zeus](https://zeusln.com/).\n\n\u003e Those sats are never truly yours until you withdraw them to a self-custodial wallet\n\n### Wallet Privacy\n\nIf you choose to top up the wallet using the convenient in-app purchase method, you will tie that small amount of Bitcoin ownership to your Nostr account. If you Nostr account is literally your name, you might not have an issue with this, but often times people like to remain pseudonymous online. If you fall into that category, using your credit card to deposit Bitcoin into your Nostr account is not a good idea.\n\nAndroid users of Primal can use an advanced technology called Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) to connect an external Lightning wallet to their Nostr account in Primal. We'll cover this in a subsequent post. \n\n\u003e Your private key allows you to take your profile and social network to any other client\n\n---\n\nIf you found this post useful, please share it with your peers and consider following and zapping me on Nostr.

Each section controls different aspects of the relay's behavior.\n\n**1. `mongodb` (Database Settings)**\n\n* **`uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/`**:\n    * This is the connection string for your MongoDB database.\n    * `mongodb://localhost:27017/` indicates that your MongoDB server is running on the same computer as your Grain relay (localhost) and listening on port 27017 (the default MongoDB port).\n    * If your MongoDB server is on a different machine, you'll need to change `localhost` to the server's IP address or hostname.\n    * The trailing `/` indicates the root of the mongodb server. You will define the database in the next line.\n* **`database: grain`**:\n    * This specifies the name of the MongoDB database that Grain will use to store Nostr events. Grain will create this database if it doesn't already exist.\n    * You can name the database whatever you want. If you want to run multiple grain relays, you can and they can have different databases running on the same mongo server. \n\n**2. `server` (Relay Server Settings)**\n\n* **`port: :8181`**:\n    * This sets the port on which your Grain relay will listen for incoming nostr websocket connections and what port the frontend will be available at.\n* **`read_timeout: 10 # in seconds`**:\n    * This is the maximum time (in seconds) that the relay will wait for a client to send data before closing the connection.\n* **`write_timeout: 10 # in seconds`**:\n    * This is the maximum time (in seconds) that the relay will wait for a client to receive data before closing the connection.\n* **`idle_timeout: 120 # in seconds`**:\n    * This is the maximum time (in seconds) that the relay will keep a connection open if there's no activity.\n* **`max_connections: 100`**:\n    * This sets the maximum number of simultaneous client connections that the relay will allow.\n* **`max_subscriptions_per_client: 10`**:\n    * This sets the maximum amount of subscriptions a single client can request from the relay.\n\n**3. `resource_limits` (System Resource Limits)**\n\n* **`cpu_cores: 2 # Limit the number of CPU cores the application can use`**:\n    * This restricts the number of CPU cores that Grain can use. Useful for controlling resource usage on your server.\n* **`memory_mb: 1024 # Cap the maximum amount of RAM in MB the application can use`**:\n    * This limits the maximum amount of RAM (in megabytes) that Grain can use.\n* **`heap_size_mb: 512 # Set a limit on the Go garbage collector's heap size in MB`**:\n    * This sets a limit on the amount of memory that the Go programming language's garbage collector can use.\n\n**4. `auth` (Authentication Settings)**\n\n* **`enabled: false # Enable or disable AUTH handling`**:\n    * If set to `true`, this enables authentication handling, requiring clients to authenticate before using the relay.\n* **`relay_url: \"wss://relay.example.com/\" # Specify the relay URL`**:\n    * If authentication is enabled, this is the url that clients will use to authenticate.\n\n**5. `UserSync` (User Synchronization)**\n\n* **`user_sync: false`**:\n    * If set to true, the relay will attempt to sync user data from other relays.\n* **`disable_at_startup: true`**:\n    * If user sync is enabled, this will prevent the sync from starting when the relay starts.\n* **`initial_sync_relays: [...]`**:\n    * A list of other relays to pull user data from.\n* **`kinds: []`**:\n    * A list of event kinds to pull from the other relays. Leaving this empty will pull all event kinds.\n* **`limit: 100`**:\n    * The limit of events to pull from the other relays.\n* **`exclude_non_whitelisted: true`**:\n    * If set to true, only users on the whitelist will have their data synced.\n* **`interval: 360`**:\n    * The interval in minutes that the relay will resync user data.\n\n**6. `backup_relay` (Backup Relay)**\n\n* **`enabled: false`**:\n    * If set to true, the relay will send copies of received events to the backup relay.\n* **`url: \"wss://some-relay.com\"`**:\n    * The url of the backup relay.\n\n**7. `event_purge` (Event Purging)**\n\n* **`enabled: false`**:\n    * If set to `true`, the relay will automatically delete old events.\n* **`keep_interval_hours: 24`**:\n    * The number of hours to keep events before purging them.\n* **`purge_interval_minutes: 240`**:\n    * How often (in minutes) the purging process runs.\n* **`purge_by_category: ...`**:\n    * Allows you to specify which categories of events (regular, replaceable, addressable, deprecated) to purge.\n* **`purge_by_kind_enabled: false`**:\n    * If set to true, events will be purged based on the kinds listed below.\n* **`kinds_to_purge: ...`**:\n    * A list of event kinds to purge.\n* **`exclude_whitelisted: true`**:\n    * If set to true, events from whitelisted users will not be purged.\n\n**8. `event_time_constraints` (Event Time Constraints)**\n\n* **`min_created_at: 1577836800`**:\n    * The minimum `created_at` timestamp (Unix timestamp) that events must have to be accepted by the relay.\n* **`max_created_at_string: now+5m`**:\n    * The maximum created at time that an event can have. This example shows that the max created at time is 5 minutes in the future from the time the event is received.\n    * `min_created_at_string` and `max_created_at` work the same way.\n\n**9. `rate_limit` (Rate Limiting)**\n\n* **`ws_limit: 100`**:\n    * The maximum number of WebSocket messages per second that the relay will accept.\n* **`ws_burst: 200`**:\n    * Allows a temporary burst of WebSocket messages.\n* **`event_limit: 50`**:\n    * The maximum number of Nostr events per second that the relay will accept.\n* **`event_burst: 100`**:\n    * Allows a temporary burst of Nostr events.\n* **`req_limit: 50`**:\n    * The limit of http requests per second.\n* **`req_burst: 100`**:\n    * The allowed burst of http requests.\n* **`max_event_size: 51200`**:\n    * The maximum size (in bytes) of a Nostr event that the relay will accept.\n* **`kind_size_limits: ...`**:\n    * Allows you to set size limits for specific event kinds.\n* **`category_limits: ...`**:\n    * Allows you to set rate limits for different event categories (ephemeral, addressable, regular, replaceable).\n* **`kind_limits: ...`**:\n    * Allows you to set rate limits for specific event kinds.\n\nBy understanding these settings, you can tailor your Grain Nostr relay to meet your specific needs and resource constraints.\n\n### whitelist.yml \n\nThe `whitelist.yml` file is used to control which users, event kinds, and domains are allowed to interact with your Grain relay. Here's a breakdown of the settings:\n\n**1. `pubkey_whitelist` (Public Key Whitelist)**\n\n* **`enabled: false`**:\n    * If set to `true`, this enables the public key whitelist. Only users whose public keys are listed will be allowed to publish events to your relay.\n* **`pubkeys:`**:\n    * A list of hexadecimal public keys that are allowed to publish events.\n    * `pubkey1` and `pubkey2` are placeholders, you will replace these with actual hexadecimal public keys.\n* **`npubs:`**:\n    * A list of npubs that are allowed to publish events.\n    * `npub18ls2km9aklhzw9yzqgjfu0anhz2z83hkeknw7sl22ptu8kfs3rjq54am44` and `npub2` are placeholders, replace them with actual npubs.\n    * npubs are bech32 encoded public keys.\n\n**2. `kind_whitelist` (Event Kind Whitelist)**\n\n* **`enabled: false`**:\n    * If set to `true`, this enables the event kind whitelist. Only events with the specified kinds will be allowed.\n* **`kinds:`**:\n    * A list of event kinds (as strings) that are allowed.\n    * `\"1\"` and `\"2\"` are example kinds. Replace these with the kinds you want to allow.\n    * Example kinds are 0 for metadata, 1 for short text notes, and 2 for recommend server.\n\n**3. `domain_whitelist` (Domain Whitelist)**\n\n* **`enabled: false`**:\n    * If set to `true`, this enables the domain whitelist. This checks the domains .well-known folder for their nostr.json. This file contains a list of pubkeys. They will be considered whitelisted if on this list. \n* **`domains:`**:\n    * A list of domains that are allowed.\n    * `\"example.com\"` and `\"anotherdomain.com\"` are example domains. Replace these with the domains you want to allow.\n\n### blacklist.yml\n\nThe `blacklist.yml` file allows you to block specific content, users, and words from your Grain relay. Here's a breakdown of the settings:\n\n**1. `enabled: true`**\n\n* This setting enables the blacklist functionality. If set to `true`, the relay will actively block content and users based on the rules defined in this file.\n\n**2. `permanent_ban_words:`**\n\n* This section lists words that, if found in an event, will result in a permanent ban for the event's author.\n* `- really bad word` is a placeholder. Replace it with any words you want to permanently block.\n\n**3. `temp_ban_words:`**\n\n* This section lists words that, if found in an event, will result in a temporary ban for the event's author.\n* `- crypto`, `- web3`, and `- airdrop` are examples. Replace them with the words you want to temporarily block.\n\n**4. `max_temp_bans: 3`**\n\n* This sets the maximum number of temporary bans a user can receive before they are permanently banned.\n\n**5. `temp_ban_duration: 3600`**\n\n* This sets the duration of a temporary ban in seconds. `3600` seconds equals one hour.\n\n**6. `permanent_blacklist_pubkeys:`**\n\n* This section lists hexadecimal public keys that are permanently blocked from using the relay.\n* `- db0c9b8acd6101adb9b281c5321f98f6eebb33c5719d230ed1870997538a9765` is an example. Replace it with the public keys you want to block.\n\n**7. `permanent_blacklist_npubs:`**\n\n* This section lists npubs that are permanently blocked from using the relay.\n* `- npub1x0r5gflnk2mn6h3c70nvnywpy2j46gzqwg6k7uw6fxswyz0md9qqnhshtn` is an example. Replace it with the npubs you want to block.\n* npubs are the human readable version of public keys.\n\n**8. `mutelist_authors:`**\n\n* This section lists hexadecimal public keys of author of a [kind1000 mutelist](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md). Pubkey authors on this mutelist will be considered on the permanent blacklist. This provides a nostr native way to handle the backlist of your relay\n* `- 3fe0ab6cbdb7ee27148202249e3fb3b89423c6f6cda6ef43ea5057c3d93088e4` is an example. Replace it with the public keys of authors that have a mutelist you would like to use as a blacklist. Consider using your own.\n* **Important Note:** The mutelist Event MUST be stored in this relay for it to be retrieved. This means your relay must have a copy of the authors kind10000 mutelist to consider them for the blacklist.\n\n\n## Running Grain as a Service:\n\n### Windows Service:\n\nTo run Grain as a Windows service, you can use tools like NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager). NSSM allows you to easily install and manage any application as a Windows service.\n\n    * For instructions on how to install NSSM, please refer to this article: [Link to NSSM install guide coming soon].\n\n1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**\n    * Open the Windows Start menu, type \"cmd,\" right-click on \"Command Prompt,\" and select \"Run as administrator.\"\n\n2.  **Navigate to NSSM Directory:**\n    * Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you extracted NSSM. For example, if you extracted it to `C:\\nssm`, you would type `cd C:\\nssm` and press Enter.\n\n3.  **Install the Grain Service:**\n    * Run the command `nssm install grain`.\n    * A GUI will appear, allowing you to configure the service.\n\n4.  **Configure Service Details:**\n    * In the \"Path\" field, enter the full path to your Grain executable (e.g., `C:\\grain\\grain_windows_amd64.exe`).\n    * In the \"Startup directory\" field, enter the directory where your Grain executable is located (e.g., `C:\\grain`).\n\n5.  **Install the Service:**\n    * Click the \"Install service\" button.\n\n6.  **Manage the Service:**\n    * You can now manage the Grain service using the Windows Services manager. Open the Start menu, type \"services.msc,\" and press Enter. You can start, stop, pause, or restart the Grain service from there.\n\n### Linux Service (systemd):\n\nTo run Grain as a Linux service, you can use systemd, the standard service manager for most modern Linux distributions.\n\n1.  **Create a Systemd Service File:**\n    * Open a text editor with root privileges (e.g., `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/grain.service`).\n\n2.  **Add Service Configuration:**\n    * Add the following content to the `grain.service` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual paths and user information:\n\n    ```toml\n    [Unit]\n    Description=Grain Nostr Relay\n    After=network.target\n\n    [Service]\n    ExecStart=/path/to/grain_linux_amd64\n    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/grain/directory\n    Restart=always\n    User=your_user #replace your_user\n    Group=your_group #replace your_group\n\n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\n    ```\n\n    * Replace `/path/to/grain/executable` with the full path to your Grain executable.\n    * Replace `/path/to/grain/directory` with the directory containing your Grain executable.\n    * Replace `your_user` and `your_group` with the username and group that will run the Grain service.\n\n3.  **Reload Systemd:**\n    * Run the command `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd configuration.\n\n4.  **Enable the Service:**\n    * Run the command `sudo systemctl enable grain.service` to enable the service to start automatically on boot.\n\n5.  **Start the Service:**\n    * Run the command `sudo systemctl start grain.service` to start the service immediately.\n\n6.  **Check Service Status:**\n    * Run the command `sudo systemctl status grain.service` to check the status of the Grain service. This will show you if the service is running and any recent logs.\n    * You can run `sudo journalctl -f -u grain.service` to watch the logs\n\nMore guides are in the works for setting up tailscale to access your relay from anywhere over a private network and for setting up a cloudflare tunnel to your domain to deploy a grain relay accessible on a subdomain of your site *eg wss://relay.yourdomain.com*","sig":"035e8288daa0a11d9c29dbab84027d97f4218660f912a076cfdfa7d47e280083adaa0ca1bf0dd9cbf8e05df8b191751c3a8298208f14c3fe63d24fffbd070591"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xg6rsdpsx56rjvfeqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyqt0rgqsp4x0l77vggcw3c8y9yxvtpyurtwxf4n98ldq0sp3kyr5kqcyqqq823cu3amvj":{"kind":30023,"id":"7dbb54051376deb404dcc618c0b3a797cc1cdf6bcef60b2c1900cd53662c8ed4","pubkey":"16f1a0100d4cfffbcc4230e8e0e4290cc5849c1adc64d6653fda07c031b1074b","created_at":1742484582,"tags":[["d","1742484054919"],["title","Installing and Using NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) on Windows"],["summary","NSSM provides a simple and effective way to run any application as a Windows service.

This post aims to dispel the myth that \"Nostr is just a Twitter replacement\" and give you a better understanding about the 'what', the 'how' and most importantly, the 'why' of Nostr.\n\n# What Is Nostr?\n\nNostr is a decentralized, open-source protocol designed for censorship-resistant networking and communication on the web. It stands for \"Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays,\" and it works by allowing users to publish messages (notes) and content in the form of 'other stuff', to a network of servers (relays) that store and distribute the content.\n\nUnlike traditional platforms like Twitter, Ebay or Facebook, Nostr doesn't rely on a central authority; instead, users control their own identities via cryptographic key pairs.\n\n\u003e The simplest open protocol that is able to create a censorship-resistant global \"social\" network once and for all.\n\u003e\n\u003eFiatjaf - Nostr Creator\n\nNostr is not a website or an app you download from a single source — it’s an open protocol, like email or the internet. Think of it as a set of rules that anyone can use to build tools for sharing messages, posts, or other data without needing a centralized middleman like a big tech company.\n\nNostr was created by a developer named Fiatjaf in 2020, and has since been steadily gaining traction among people who care about privacy, freedom, and censorship resistance.\n\n![](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/nostr101-2.png)\n\n# Why Nostr?\n\nImagine the scenario, you've been using an online platform for 5 or even 10 years. You've built up thousands of contacts, perhaps built yourself a sizeable reputation, or even rely on the income from the platform to feed your family. Then one day you make a controversial post, sell a certain item or upload a video on a spicy subject to the platform where the owner disagrees with. With the click of a button, your account is removed. All trace of you, your social graph, or even your future income, disappears in an instant.\n\nRead aloud like that is sounds crazy that we'd even entertain using such a platform, right!? Sadly that is the reality in 2025. This is exactly what happens every single day on X, Facebook, Ebay, Paypal, Linkedin, etc.\n\nLooking at the problem through a more social media focused lens, many of us have become slaves to the likes of Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. We use these 'free' apps under the guise of being social with others online. The reality is that we see what those apps want us to see. We've become slaves to the manipulation of complex and opaque algrorithms designed to keep us hooked and try to sell us things.\n\n![](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/nostr101-3.png)\n\nUnlike traditional platforms, which are often governed by centralized entities wielding significant control over user data, content moderation, and algorithmic influence, Nostr flips the script by prioritizing user sovereignty and resilience. Built on an open-source framework, Nostr allows individuals to control their own data and interact through a network of relays, making it much more difficult for any single authority - be it a corporation, government, or bad actor - to censor or manipulate the flow of information.\n\n- Is a relay refusing to host your notes? Use another or run your own!\n- A specific client using an algorithm you don't like, take your identity and social graph elsewhere and choose another!\n\n\u003e Take your identity and social graph with you, anywhere any time.\n\nNostr’s ability to foster authentic, unfiltered conversations while safeguarding user sovereignty has made it a cornerstone for communities seeking alternatives - whether they’re activists, creators, or everyday people tired of being pawns in the data-driven game. It's simple and adaptable design also encourages innovation, inviting developers to build tools and interfaces that keep pushing the boundaries of what the decentralized internet can achieve. In short, Nostr isn’t just a tool; it’s a movement toward a freer, more equitable digital future.\n\n![](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/nostr101-4.png)\n\n# How Does Nostr Work?\n\nInstead of one giant server owned by a single company holding all your posts and messages, Nostr spreads everything across lots of smaller servers called relays. To [get started](https://hellonostr.xyz/start), you download a client, create your account and back up your private key. Your private key is used to secure your account and sign every message you send over the network. This allows anyone you interact with the verify the integrity of the data coming from 'you'.\n\n\u003e The Nostr network is essentially a collection of bulletin boards that share a common format\n\nWhen you write a note, or share some other type of compatible data, your client signs it with your private key, then sends it to one or more relays. Which relays your information is sent to is entirely up to you. These relays share your message with others who want to see it.\n\nFor others to see your notes or 'other stuff', they'll need to be able to find you. Typically this is done by using your public key, which looks something like this `npub15c88nc8d44gsp4658dnfu5fahswzzu8gaxm5lkuwjud068swdqfspxssvx`. Don't panic though, you don't need to memorize all of your friends public keys, there are more human friendly methods of finding people that we'll come onto later.\n\nOnce someone is following you, their client will ask all of their connected relays for any data shared by your public key. Their client will receive this data, verify it is signed by your private key and then populate it into their feed.\n\n![](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/nostr101.jpeg)\n\n# The “Other Stuff” Explained\n\nNostr’s name hints at this: Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays. But what is the “other stuff”? Put simply, it’s all the creative and experimental things people are building on Nostr, beyond simple text based notes. Every action on Nostr is an event - like a post, a profile update, or even a payment. The 'Kind' is what specifies the purpose of each event. Kinds are the building blocks of how information is categorized and processed on the network, and the most popular become part of higher lever specification guidelines known as [Nostr Implementation Possibility - NIP](https://nostr-nips.com/). A NIP is a document that defines how something in Nostr should work, including the rules, standards, or features. NIPs define the type of 'other stuff' that be published and displayed by different styles of client for different purposes.\n\nHere's some content examples of 'Other Stuff':\n\n1. Long-Form Content: Think blog posts or articles. [NIP-23](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-23).\n2. Private Messaging: Encrypted chats between users. [NIP-04](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-04).\n3. Communities: Group chats or forums like Reddit. [NIP-72](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-72)\n4. Marketplaces: People listing stuff for sale, payable with zaps. [NIP-15](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-15)\n5. Zaps: Value transfer over the Lightning Network. [NIP57](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-57)\n\nThe beauty of Nostr is that it’s a flexible foundation. Developers can dream up new ideas and build them into clients, and the relays just keep humming along, passing the data around. It’s still early days, so expect the “other stuff” to grow wilder and weirder over time!\n\n# Clients vs Relays: What’s the Difference?\n\nNewbies often get tripped up by these two terms, so let’s clearly define them.\n\n![](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/nostr101-5.png)\n\n### Clients\n\nA client is what you use to interact with Nostr. It’s the app or website where you type your posts, read your feed, follow and interact with others. Examples of Nostr clients include:\n\n- [Damus](https://damus.io/) (iOS Twitter style client)\n- [Primal](https://primal.net/download) (Cross-platform Twitter style client)\n- [Amethyst](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst) (Android only Twitter style client)\n- [Habla.News](https://habla.news/) (Web based blog client)\n- [Olas](https://github.com/pablof7z/olas) (Instagram style client)\n- [0xchat](https://nostrapps.com/0xchat) (Messaging client)\n\nClients don’t store your data; they just pull it from relays and display it for you. You can switch clients whenever you want, and your account stays the same because it’s tied to your keys, not any single client or app.\n\n\u003e Clients are how you use Nostr, and relays are where the data lives. You need both to make the magic happen.\n\n### Relays\n\nA relay is a server that stores and shares Nostr data. It’s a little like a post office: you send your note to a relay, and it delivers it to anyone who’s subscribed to see it (like your followers). Relays are run by individuals, groups, or companies who volunteer their computing power. Some are free, some charge a small fee, and you can connect to as many as you like. Most clients will come pre-configured with a list of well-known relays, but you can add or remove any you like.\n\n# What Are Zaps?\n\nZaps are arguably one of Nostr’s coolest features! A zaps is a way to send payments in Bitcoin directly to other users. Imagine liking a post, but instead of just clicking a heart (which you can of course do), you send the poster a few cents worth of Bitcoin to say, “This is awesome!”.\n\nZaps use Bitcoin's Lightning Network, a faster and cheaper way to move Bitcoin around. To Zap someone, you need a Lightning wallet linked to your Nostr client. Some clients, like Primal, ship with their own custodial wallet to make getting started a breeze. Most clients also allow more advanced users to connect an existing Lightning Wallet to reduce reliance and trust in the client provider.\n\nZaps are optional but add a fun layer to Nostr. Creators love them because it’s a way to get direct support from fans, with no middleman required.\n\n![](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/primal-10.png)\n\n# NIP-05 Identifiers: Your Nostr “Username”\n\nYour nPub, or public key (that long string of letters and numbers) is your 'official' Nostr ID, but it’s not exactly catchy. Enter [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) identifiers, a human-readable and easily sharable way to have people find you. They look like an email address, like `qna@hellonostr.xyz`.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nMost users obtain their NIP-05 ID from a website or service that supports Nostr. Some of these services are free whereas some charge a [fee](https://bitcoiner.chat/). Some clients, like [Primal](https://primal.net/) will set one up for you automatically when you create an account. The email like ID links to your public key, so people can find you more easily. And because these ID's are domain based, there can be no duplicates. qna@hellonostr.xyz can only map to a single public key. The only person that can change that link is the person in control of the domain.\n\nIf you control your own domain, you can easily map your Nostr public key to name@my.domain. It’s not mandatory, but it’s super useful for building trust and making your profile recognizable.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nSo you're bought in.

This makes it highly scalable and adaptable for various applications. This guide will focus on installing the **Community Server** edition, which is free and open-source.\n\nThis article is designed for **beginners** and those new to MongoDB, providing a clear and concise walkthrough of the installation process. We will cover installation on both **Windows** and **Linux** operating systems.\n\nThe official MongoDB documentation on the MongoDB website is very informative and you should be able to follow their guides. This article is written to provide a brief overview and a more streamlined installation experience.\n\n# Prerequisites\n\nMongoDB Community Server can be installed and run on a wide range of systems. While specific hardware requirements can vary based on your intended use case and the size of your database, here are the general prerequisites:\n\n* **Operating System:**\n    * This guide will cover installation on popular versions of Windows and Linux (specifically Ubuntu/Debian). MongoDB also supports other operating systems, which you can find on the official MongoDB website.\n* **Storage Space:**\n    * You'll need sufficient disk space to store your database files. The amount of space required will depend on the size of your data. It is recommended to have more storage than you think you will initially need.\n* **RAM:**\n    * While MongoDB can run with minimal RAM, having more RAM will improve performance, especially for larger databases. The amount of RAM needed will depend on the size of your data.\n* **Basic System Knowledge:**\n    * Familiarity with using the command line or terminal is helpful, especially for Linux installations.\n    * Basic understanding of file systems and directories.\n\nEssentially, MongoDB is designed to be flexible and can run on most modern systems. As your data grows, you can always scale your hardware accordingly.\n\n## Downloading MongoDB Community Server:\n\nTo begin, you'll need to download the MongoDB Community Server installation package.\n\n* Visit the official MongoDB download page: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)\n\nOn the download page, you'll see options to select the following:\n\n* **Version:** Choose the desired version of MongoDB. It is generally recommended to select the latest stable release.\n* **Operating System:** Select your operating system (Windows or Linux).\n* **Package:** Select the appropriate package type. For Windows, it will typically be `msi`. For Linux, you will choose the package type that aligns with your linux distro. For example `.deb` for Debian/Ubuntu or `.rpm` for RedHat/Fedora.\n\nOnce you have made your selections, click the \"Download\" button to download the installer or package.\n\n## Installation on Windows:\n\n### Running the Installer:\n\n1.  **Locate the Downloaded Installer:**\n    * Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the MongoDB `.msi` installer.\n\n2.  **Run the Installer:**\n    * Double-click the `.msi` file to start the installation wizard.\n\n3.  **Welcome Screen:**\n    * Click \"Next\" on the welcome screen.\n\n4.  **License Agreement:**\n    * Read the license agreement, check the \"I accept the terms in the License Agreement\" box, and click \"Next.\"\n\n5.  **Setup Type:**\n    * Select \"Custom\" installation. This allows you to choose the installation location and data directory. Click \"Next.\"\n\n6.  **Installation Location:**\n    * You can change the default installation directory if desired. Click \"Next.\"\n\n7.  **Service Configuration:**\n    * You can choose to install MongoDB as a service. It is recommended to install as a service.\n    * You can also change the \"Data Directory\" location here. It is recommended to change this to a location such as `C:\\data\\db`. If you do not change it here, you will need to create the data directory manually later.\n    * Click \"Next.\"\n\n8.  **Ready to Install:**\n    * Click \"Install\" to begin the installation process.\n\n9.  **Complete Installation:**\n    * Once the installation is complete, click \"Finish.\"\n\n### Setting Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):\n\nSetting the `PATH` environment variable allows you to run MongoDB commands from any command prompt window without specifying the full path to the executable.\n\n1.  **Open System Properties:**\n    * Search for \"Environment Variables\" in the Windows Start menu and select \"Edit the system environment variables.\"\n\n2.  **Environment Variables:**\n    * In the \"System Properties\" window, click the \"Environment Variables...\" button.\n\n3.  **Edit Path Variable:**\n    * In the \"System variables\" section, find the \"Path\" variable and click \"Edit.\"\n\n4.  **Add MongoDB Bin Directory:**\n    * Click \"New\" and add the path to the MongoDB `bin` directory. This is typically `C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\\u003cversion\u003e\\bin`, replacing `\u003cversion\u003e` with your installed version.\n    * Click \"OK\" on all open windows to save the changes.\n\n5.  **Verify Path:**\n    * Open a new command prompt window and type `mongod --version`. If MongoDB is installed correctly and the `PATH` variable is set, you should see the MongoDB version information.\n\n## Installation on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):\n\nThese instructions are specifically for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu.\n\n### Importing the MongoDB Public GPG Key:\n\n1.  **Open a Terminal:**\n    * Open your terminal application.\n\n2.  **Import the GPG Key:**\n    * Run the following command to import the MongoDB public GPG key:\n\n    ```bash\n    wget -qO - [https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc](https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc) | sudo apt-key add -\n    ```\n\n    * This command downloads the GPG key and adds it to your system's trusted keys. This ensures that the packages you download from the MongoDB repository are authentic.\n\n### Adding the MongoDB Repository:\n\n1.  **Add the Repository:**\n    * Run the following command to add the MongoDB repository to your system's sources list:\n\n    ```bash\n    echo \"deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] [https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu](https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu) $(lsb_release -cs)/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list\n    ```\n\n    * This command adds the MongoDB repository to your system's package manager sources. The `$(lsb_release -cs)` part automatically determines your Ubuntu/Debian version.\n\n2.  **Update Package List:**\n    * Run the following command to update your package list:\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo apt update\n    ```\n\n    * This command refreshes the package list, including the newly added MongoDB repository.\n\n### Installing MongoDB:\n\n1.  **Install MongoDB:**\n    * Run the following command to install the MongoDB Community Server:\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo apt install mongodb-org\n    ```\n\n    * This command downloads and installs the MongoDB packages.\n\n*After install, linux and windows should both have a system service already setup from the install process. You can check if it's running on linux with `sudo systemctl status mongod`. On Windows, you should see the service running as \"MongoDB Server\" if you open system services on Windows*\n\n## Basic MongoDB Commands:\n\nAfter installing and starting MongoDB, you can use the `mongo` shell to interact with your database. Here are some basic commands to get you started:\n\n**Checking MongoDB Version:**\n\nFirst, let's verify that MongoDB is installed correctly by checking its version:\n\n1.  **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**\n    * Open your terminal (Linux/macOS) or command prompt (Windows).\n\n2.  **Run `mongosh --version`:**\n    * Type `mongosh --version` and press Enter.\n    * This command will display the installed MongoDB version if it's correctly installed and in your system's PATH.\n\n**Basic MongoDB Shell Commands:**\n\n1.  **Open the `mongosh` Shell:**\n    * Type `mongosh` and press Enter. This will open the MongoDB shell, and you'll see a prompt like `\u003e`.\n\n2.  **Show Databases:**\n    * To see a list of all databases on your MongoDB server, type `show dbs` and press Enter.\n    * This will display a list of database names.\n\n3.  **Use a Database:**\n    * To switch to a specific database, type `use \u003cdatabase_name\u003e` and press Enter. Replace `\u003cdatabase_name\u003e` with the name of the database you want to use.\n    * Example: `use mydatabase`\n    * If the database doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it when you first store data in it.\n\n4.  **Show Collections:**\n    * After switching to a database, you can see a list of collections (similar to tables in relational databases) in that database by typing `show collections` and pressing Enter.\n    * Collections are where you store documents (JSON-like data).\n\n**Example Session:**\n\n```bash\n\u003e mongosh\nCurrent Mongosh Log ID: 6563728637951a37887e2730\nConnecting to:          mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true\u0026serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000\u0026appName=mongosh\nUsing MongoDB:          7.0.3\nUsing Mongosh:          2.1.1\nFor mongosh info see: [https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/](https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/)\n\ntest\u003e show dbs\nadmin   40 KiB\nconfig  72 KiB\nlocal   40 KiB\ntest\u003e use mydatabase\nswitched to db mydatabase\nmydatabase\u003e show collections\nmydatabase\u003e\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully installed and started MongoDB Community Server. You've learned how to download, install, and run MongoDB on both Windows and Linux systems, and you've explored some basic commands to interact with your database.\n\nNow, you might want to try an application like grain, a Nostr relay, which utilizes MongoDB as its database. \nLearn How to Install grain: nostr:naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzq9h35qgq6n8ll0xyyv8gurjzjrx9sjwp4hry6ejnlks8cqcmzp6tqqxnzde5xg6rqdpnx56rqv34uyz5g4\n\nRemember, this guide covers the basics. There's much more to explore in the world of MongoDB, including advanced querying, indexing, replication, and sharding. Continue exploring the official MongoDB documentation to deepen your knowledge and unlock the full potential of this powerful database.\n","sig":"62dc67775d02a32f57f31985017e3ea682c6c4309efcb60c078294eb154c4673e14b350803e5d5990454c68d220784bc81774a846aefd7a4f684f7d0ee9a8779"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xgenzvf5xgmr2ve4qyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyznqu70qakk4zqxh2sakd8j38k7pcgtsar5mwn7m36t34lg7pe5pxqcyqqq823cfhg929":{"kind":30023,"id":"125dd2bda5e25fe6cfd6484eeada4f93a2263dec9d4528f53d1f5dc143e6b3fd","pubkey":"a60e79e0edad5100d7543b669e513dbc1c2170e8e9b74fdb8e971afd1e0e6813","created_at":1742312305,"tags":[["d","1742311426535"],["title","Secure your Nsec with Amber"],["summary","An introduction to the Nostr event signer for Android"],["t","nsec"],["t","security"],["t","nostr"],["t","amber"],["image","https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amberhero1.png"],["published_at","1742312260"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzpfsw08swmt23qrt4gwmxnegnm0quy9cw36dhfldca9c6l50qu6qnqqxnzde5xgenzvf5xgmr2ve4kc0p5e"]],"content":"**This is a long form note test of a post that lives on my Nostr educational website [Hello Nostr](https://hellonostr.xyz) **\n\nOne of the first things most people learn when getting started with Nostr is the importance of their private key, or ‘nsec’. The nsec is the key to their Nostr world. Whoever controls an nsec, controls that account. Lose access to the nsec and you lose access to that account and its social graph.\n\nSo the nsec is very important and should be treated very carefully, but what happens if we want to use or test multiple Nostr clients? Newer clients might be malicious, or have unknown security vulnerabilities, so simply go pasting our nsec everywhere just to see if we like a new app is not the best idea!\n\nThankfully there are solutions for nsec management that allow us to do exactly that, without having to expose our all important nsec to each and every app we want to interact with. The most commonly used to date are browser extensions like Alby or nos2x. Typically these types of browser extensions do not work on mobile platforms.\n\nEnter Amber…\n\n![Amber Event Signer](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amberhero.png)\n\n## What is Amber?\nAmber is a free and open source Android application that serves as a dedicated ‘Nostr event signer’. Amber allows users to keep their nsec segregated in a single, dedicated app. The goal of Amber is to have your smartphone act as a NIP-46 signing device without any need for servers or additional hardware.\n\nAt its core Amber serves two main purposes:\n\nSecuring your nsec(s)\nUsing this nsec to sign events for other Nostr clients on your phone\n\n\u003e Got an iPhone? Check out [nsec.app](https://nostrapps.com/nsec-app)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Download Amber to your phone. It is available from Zap Store, Obtanium, GitHub or F-Droid\n\nDownload Amber [here](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Amber/releases).\nSupport Amber [here](https://greenart7c3.com/).\n\n2. When opening Amber for the first time, you’ll have the option to create a new Nostr account (nsec) or import an existing one.\n![Getting Started](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amber1.png)\n\n3. If you do not currently have a Nostr account, Amber will help you generate and secure a brand new nsec. Amber allows you to download an encrypted file containing your nsec as well as the option to download a human-readable version of the nsec in the form of 12 English words, similar to a Bitcoin seed.\n![Creating a new account](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amber2.png)\n\n\u003e Skip this step if you have an existing nsec that you want to import to Amber.\n\n4. To import an existing nsec, choose ‘Use your private key’. You can then paste the nsec from an existing client, or scan a QR code of it if you have one available to you.\n![Importing an nsec](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amber3-1.png)\n\n5. Once you have created or imported your nsec, Amber will ask for some basic permissions. You can allow the app the approve basic actions, or enable more granular selection for each client you subsequently connect. Once you tap ‘Finish’, you’ll see that the account is now ready.\n\nIf you have or require more than one Nostr account, you can repeat these steps for each one. All accounts can be viewed by tapping the profile image in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n![Account Active](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amber4.png)\n\n6. That’s it, Amber is now ready to sign events. Amber allows multiple ways to connect other clients to it, but most will have a very simple ‘Login with Amber’ button. Let’s demo this in practice with [Amethyst](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst), the most popular Android-only client.\n\nThe opening screen of Amethyst shows the ‘Login with Amber’ option. Tap that.\n![Connecting Amethyst to Amber](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amber5.png)\n\n7. Amber will then open automatically and ask you to define the level of autonomy you’d like to have with Amethyst. This setting defines how often Amber will require you to manually authorize each event.\n\nFor example, you might want Amber to automatically sign every like or repost you do in Amethyst, but then be asked to manually approve all direct messages sent from your account. These permissions can be customized in the settings at any time.\n![Setting Permissions](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amber6.png)\n\n8. Let’s assume that upon setup, we did not grant Amber the ability to automatically sign short text notes for us. Let’s look at how simple the authorization flow is. Type a new short note in Amethyst and press ‘Post’.\n\nAmethyst will instantly send the request to the Amber app on your phone, with no third party server involved. Amber will open and ask you to approve the event. When you do, Amber signs the event with the nsec it stores for you and automatically send the signed event back to Amethyst to be posted. The whole process takes just a few seconds.\n![Authorizing an event](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amber7.png)\n\n## Using Amber with a Web Client\n\n1. Next let’s take a look at how you can use Amber on your phone to sign events on a web app running on your computer. For this example, we’ll be using Coracle. Open Coracle and click ‘Log In’, then choose ‘Use Remote Signer’. Coracle will then display a QR code.\n![Coracle Remote Log In](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/coracle.png)\n\n2. Open Amber and navigate to the Applications page, tap the + icon, then scan the QR code being displayed by Coracle.\n![Coracle QR log in](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/amber8.png)\n\n3. Just as it did earlier with Amethyst, Amber will now ask you to grant some basic permissions for the Coracle connection. Once again, these permissions can be customized at any time in the settings. Once granted, you’ll notice that Coracle automatically logs in to your feed.\n![Logged in to Coracle](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/coracle3.png)\n\nBut wait, how did that happen? The nsec is in Amber on your phone, and Coracle is running on your computer. The two might not even be in the same location or on the same network!? The communication is happening over the Nostr protocol, via relays. Which relays are used for this communication can be configured in the Amber settings.\n\n4. Let’s test out a short note on Coracle to demonstrate the signing process. Click ‘Post +’ in the top right corner, draft your note and then click send.\n![Creating a note in Coracle](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/coraclenote.png)\n\n5. Amber will send a push notification to your phone. Tapping the notification will open Amber for you to approve the event.\n![Authorizing the event](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/coraclesign.png)\n\n6. Once the event is approved in Amber, Amber will automatically send the signed event back to Coracle for publishing.\n![Event published](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/coraclenoteposted.png)\n\n\n## Summary\nYou can view Amber as a vault for your Nostr private keys (nsec).

Introduction\n\nIn decentralized systems like Nostr, preserving privacy and ensuring censorship resistance are paramount. However, the inherent design ethos opens the platform to multiple vulnerabilities, chief among them being the susceptibility to Sybil attacks. The problem space is not only technical but also socio-economic, where user privacy and ease-of-use must be balanced against mitigations that impose friction on identity creation actions.\n\nThis report details a multi-faceted research analysis into Sybil resistance mechanisms, drawing analogies from contemporary decentralized identity systems, cryptographic protocols, and economic disincentives. We incorporate detailed insights from diverse independent research streams, outlining both established and novel approaches, and present a series of design recommendations for Nostr. The analysis is targeted at highly experienced analysts and researchers, with comprehensive details on both the cryptographic primitives used and the overall system architectures.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Background: The Threat of Sybil Attacks in Decentralized Systems\n\n### 2.1. Sybil Attacks Defined\n\nA Sybil attack involves a single adversary generating a multitude of pseudonymous identities to unduly influence network decisions, voting mechanisms, or content dissemination processes. In systems designed for censorship resistance, where anonymity is embraced, such attacks are especially daunting because traditional verification methods are not readily applicable.\n\n### 2.2. The Unique Challenges in Nostr\n\nNostr is celebrated for its emphatic commitment to censorship resistance and privacy. This design choice, however, leads to several inherent challenges:\n\n- **Weak Identity Verification:** Mechanisms like nip5, a simple email-like verification protocol, lack robustness and are vulnerable in environments where linking multiple pseudonymous identities is trivial.\n- **Economic Incentives:** Systems using zaps (small value transactions or tips) intend to add cost to malicious actions but struggle with effective proof of expenditure. In some instances, attackers may even benefit from a net positive revenue.\n- **Association Networks:** Existing follow systems provide decentralized webs of association; however, they do not imply a real trust framework, leaving only superficial links among identities.\n\nThe dual objectives of achieving ease-of-use while robustly mitigating Sybil attacks requires a careful, in-depth analysis of multiple design trade-offs.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Detailed Analysis of Existing Mechanisms and Proposed Enhancements\n\nIn our research, several proposals and implementations have emerged to address the Sybil-resistance conundrum. We examine these solutions in detail below.\n\n### 3.1. Cryptographic and Identity-Based Approaches\n\n#### 3.1.1. Aut-CT with Curve Trees\n\nOne of the notable approaches employs the Aut-CT mechanism which leverages **Curve Trees**. Key insights include:\n\n- **Mechanism:** Constructing an algebraic analog of a Merkle tree with curve-based keys.\n- **Verification Efficiency:** Achieves logarithmic verification times (typically 40–70 ms) even for large keysets (from 50K to over 2.5M keys).\n- **Proof Size:** Consistently maintains a proof size of around 3–4 kB, making it effective for low-bandwidth scenarios.\n- **Key Image:** The integrated DLEQ-based method produces a key image that binds a proof to a hidden key, preventing fraudulent re-use of tokens.\n\n*Implication:* This method, while promising, requires integration sophistication. It can potentially be adapted for Nostr to ensure that each identity is backed by a verifiable, anonymous proof of ownership—raising the cost of forging or duplicating identities.\n\n#### 3.1.2. Economic Disincentives and Token Burning\n\nIn the realm of cryptocurrency mixers, enforcing an economic cost for generating identities has seen traction. The following methods are prominent:\n\n- **Token Burning/Deposit Mechanisms:** Users deposit funds that serve as a bond. Forging multiple identities becomes economically prohibitive if these tokens are sacrificial.\n- **Time Locks and Coin-Age Restrictions:** By enforcing waiting periods or requiring funds to ‘age’, systems ensure that rapid, mass identity creation is deterred.\n- **Fidelity Bonds:** Users risk losing bonds if identified as malicious, creating a strong economic disincentive.\n\n*Observation:* Nostr could potentially adopt analogous economic primitives that impose a non-trivial cost on identity creation, helping to scale the disincentive to the level required for a system where anonymity is paramount.\n\n#### 3.1.3. Decentralized Identity Systems\n\nA comparative analysis of identity systems, both centralized and decentralized, underscores the following:\n\n- **Centralized Systems (LDAP, OAuth, etc.):** While scalable, they inherently conflict with the decentralized and censorship-resistant philosophy of Nostr.\n- **Decentralized Systems (uPort, Hyperledger Indy, etc.):** These systems leverage blockchain technologies and zero-knowledge proofs to ensure self-sovereign identity management. However, they often require complex deployments and higher operational overhead.\n\n*Trade-Off Assessment:* Implementing a fully decentralized identity system in Nostr must balance ease-of-use with strong cryptographic assurances. A layered approach—using decentralized identifiers with optional verifications—may yield optimal usability without sacrificing security.\n\n### 3.2. Protocol-Specific Countermeasures\n\n#### 3.2.1. Rechained Protocol\n\nThe Rechained protocol introduces a deposit-based identity generation mechanism in IoT and mobile ad hoc networks. Here are its salient points:\n\n- **Deposit Transaction:** Each identity is tied to a deposit transaction on a public blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n- **Parameterization:** Parameters like minHeight, minDifficulty, and amounts ensure that each identity requires a certain financial threshold to be met.\n- **Verification Complexity:** Though proof sizes are modest (10–50 KB) and verification times are around 2 seconds, these are acceptable trade-offs on modern consumer-grade devices.\n\n*Application Prospects:* If Nostr could integrate a variant of Rechained, it may allow identities to be tied to a verifiable deposit, thus raising the cost baseline for attackers. Such integration must ensure user-friendliness and minimal friction during onboarding.\n\n#### 3.2.2. Sysname Decentralized Identity Scheme\n\nSysname presents an innovative approach with additional privacy-preserving features:\n\n- **Selective Disclosure:** It allows users to reveal only non-identifying attributes proving compliance with certain predicates without exposing their full identity.\n- **Chain-Pinned Identifiers:** Aggregates multiple pseudonyms to a single on-chain record, reducing the ease with which an attacker can use disparate identities without accountability.\n- **Key Recovery:** Enables users to refresh public keys and recover lost keys, which bolsters user trust and system resilience.\n\n*Consideration:* Integrating aspects of sysname within Nostr could offer both enhanced privacy and Sybil resistance, yielding a balance between security and user independence. Enhanced key recovery also addresses the usability concerns evidenced by historical failures in PGP adoption.\n\n### 3.3. Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection\n\nAs an additional countermeasure, behavioral analysis can serve as a secondary layer of defense. Given the evolving sophistication of bots, a cat-and-mouse game inevitably ensues:\n\n- **Machine Learning Based Detection:** Frameworks like a deep intrusion detection system (DIDS) combined with blockchain smart contracts can help identify anomalous posting behaviors. For example, integrations using Particle Swarm Optimization–Gravitational Search Algorithm (ePSOGSA) with deep autoencoders have proven accurate on established benchmarks.\n- **Economic Implications:** By analyzing behavior, the systems can prioritize identities that have accrued economic transactions (like zaps) that match genuine user behavior over automated, bot-like patterns.\n- **Limitations:** While promising, such systems introduce computational overhead and may yield false positives, so the implementation must be cautiously engineered with appropriate fail-safes.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Trade-Offs and Comprehensive Evaluation\n\n### 4.1. Usability vs. Security\n\nOne of the central themes in designing defenses against Sybil attacks on Nostr is balancing ease-of-use with robust security. A highly secure system that remains cumbersome to use (akin to the historical PGP deployment) may fail adoption. Conversely, ease-of-use without economic or cryptographic Assurance opens the door to cost-free identity creation and abuse.\n\n- **Economic Approaches:** Impose a direct cost on identity creation but must be calibrated to avoid excluding well-intentioned users, particularly newcomers or those with limited funds.\n- **Cryptographic Protocols:** Solutions like Aut-CT and sysname offer advanced cryptographic proofs with minimal overhead in verification but could require more sophisticated client implementations.\n- **Behavioral Analysis:** Acts as a safety net but must be continuously updated as adversaries evolve their bot strategies.\n\n### 4.2. Privacy Implications\n\nEvery mechanism proposed must be evaluated in terms of its ability to preserve user privacy. Nostr’s value proposition rests on its censorship resistance and privacy-preserving design. Therefore:\n\n- **Selective Disclosure Protocols:** Techniques that allow for proving predicates without full identity revelation should be prioritized (as seen in sysname).\n- **Decentralized Identity Aggregation:** Methods that tie multiple pseudonyms to a single verifiable chain of evidence (enhancing accountability) can reduce risk without compromising anonymity.\n- **Economic Proof Versus User Balance:** The economic barriers should not expose additional metadata that can be linked back to users. Hence, anonymizing tokens and cryptographic blinding techniques need to be integral to the design.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Proposed Comprehensive Strategy for Nostr\n\nBased on the research, a multi-layered defense strategy is recommended. It incorporates both cryptographic assurances and economic disincentives while integrating behavioral analysis. The following blueprint emerges:\n\n### 5.1. Implementation Blueprint\n\n1. **Integration of Curve Tree-Based Aut-CT Proofs:**\n   - Require each new identity creation to be validated via a Curve Tree-based proof of key ownership. This approach leverages zero-knowledge proofs and ensures logarithmic verification times, thus scalable even for a large user base.\n   - Address token re-use and fake identity creation by integrating key images as established in the Aut-CT mechanism.\n\n2. **Economic Deposit Mechanism (Inspired by Rechained):**\n   - Incorporate a lightweight deposit mechanism where users must commit a small deposit, recorded on a public blockchain. This deposit acts as a minimum hurdle for each identity and may be partially refundable upon earning trust.\n   - Experiment with dynamic deposit sizes based on network load and risk assessments, ensuring that the economic threshold is both feasible and deterring.\n\n3. **Selective Disclosure and Pseudonym Aggregation (Adapting Sysname Principles):**\n   - Allow users to prove characteristics about their identities (age, locality, etc.) without divulging full identifying details.\n   - Aggregate multiple pseudonyms provided by the same user on-chain, using cryptographic commitments that both link identities and allow selective disclosure.\n\n4. **Optional Layer: Economic and Behavioral Analytics:**\n   - Deploy a deep anomaly detection layer using machine learning techniques on posting behavior, ensuring that anomalous activities (e.g., rapid posting similar to bots) are flagged.\n   - Integrate smart contract-based economic triggers that penalize suspicious behavior while maintaining user privacy.\n\n### 5.2. Addressing Adoption and Usability Concerns\n\n- **User Experience (UX):** The proposed solutions must be integrated transparently into client applications. Much like improved versions of PGP aim to streamline key management, Nostr clients should embed these cryptographic protocols without requiring manual intervention.\n- **Modular Onboarding:** Allow users to opt into various levels of proof. Early adopters may use lightweight methods, with a progressive enhancement available for those seeking higher assurance as they interact more within the network.\n- **Wallet and Key Management Integration:** Leverage existing wallet infrastructures to ease the economic deposit and key recovery processes, drawing user confidence from familiarity with mainstream crypto applications.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Future Work and Speculative Technologies\n\nWhile the proposals above are based on current and emergent technologies, additional research can further refine these approaches:\n\n- **Adaptive Economic Models:** Future work can explore dynamic, context-aware deposit requirements that adjust based on network activity, risk profiles, and even market conditions.\n- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography:** As quantum computing progresses, integrating quantum-resistant algorithms in curve-tree constructions will become imperative for long-term viability.\n- **Interoperable Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Creating cross-system standards for identity verification may allow Nostr to interface with other decentralized platforms, enhancing the overall security ecosystem.\n- **Advancements in Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Considering high-level academic research on ZKPs, such as bulletproofs and recursive ZKPs, can further improve both the scalability and succinctness of cryptographic proofs required for identity validation.\n\n*Speculative Note:* As adversaries adapt, we may see the emergence of hybrid systems where off-chain reputation systems are cryptographically linked to on-chain proofs, creating a multi-dimensional defense that continuously evolves through machine learning and adaptive economic incentives.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nMitigating Sybil attacks on Nostr necessitates a proactive, multi-layered approach combining advanced cryptographic techniques, economic disincentives, decentralized verification mechanisms, and behavioral analytics. The proposals detailed in this report aim to reinforce Nostr’s resilience while maintaining its foundational commitment to privacy and censorship resistance.\n\nBy integrating Curve Tree-based proofs, economic deposit mechanisms, and selective disclosure methods, Nostr can build a robust identity framework that is both user-friendly and resistant to abuse. Continued research into adaptive economic models and quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques will ensure that the system remains secure in the evolving landscape of decentralized networks.\n\nThorough evaluation of trade-offs, user experience enhancements, and iterative testing on live networks will be critical. This report serves as a foundational blueprint for further exploration and eventual deployment of sophisticated Sybil defense mechanisms within Nostr.\n\n---\n\n## 8.

Troubleshooting\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- A Debian or Ubuntu server\n- Basic familiarity with command line operations (most steps are explained in detail)\n- Root or sudo access to your server\n\n## Initial Server Setup\n\nFirst, let's make sure your server is properly set up and secured.\n\n### Update Your System\n\nConnect to your server via SSH and update your system:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade -y\n```\n\n### Set Up a Basic Firewall\n\nInstall and configure a basic firewall:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install ufw -y\nsudo ufw allow ssh\nsudo ufw enable\n```\n\nThis allows SSH connections while blocking other ports for security.\n\n## Installing Strfry Nostr Relay\n\nThis guide includes the full range of steps needed to build and set up Strfry. It's simply based on the current version of the `DEPLOYMENT.md` document in the Strfry GitHub repository. If the build/setup process is changed in the repo, this document could get outdated. If so, please report to me that something is outdated and check for updated steps [here](https://github.com/hoytech/strfry/blob/master/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\nFirst, let's install the necessary dependencies. Each package serves a specific purpose in building and running Strfry:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y git build-essential libyaml-perl libtemplate-perl libregexp-grammars-perl libssl-dev zlib1g-dev liblmdb-dev libflatbuffers-dev libsecp256k1-dev libzstd-dev\n```\n\nHere's why each dependency is needed:\n\n**Basic Development Tools:**\n- `git`: Version control system used to clone the Strfry repository and manage code updates\n- `build-essential`: Meta-package that includes compilers (gcc, g++), make, and other essential build tools\n\n**Perl Dependencies** (used for Strfry's build scripts):\n- `libyaml-perl`: Perl interface to parse YAML configuration files\n- `libtemplate-perl`: Template processing system used during the build process\n- `libregexp-grammars-perl`: Advanced regular expression handling for Perl scripts\n\n**Core Libraries for Strfry:**\n- `libssl-dev`: Development files for OpenSSL, used for secure connections and cryptographic operations\n- `zlib1g-dev`: Compression library that Strfry uses to reduce data size\n- `liblmdb-dev`: Lightning Memory-Mapped Database library, which Strfry uses for its high-performance database backend\n- `libflatbuffers-dev`: Memory-efficient serialization library for structured data\n- `libsecp256k1-dev`: Optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1, essential for Nostr's cryptographic signatures\n- `libzstd-dev`: Fast real-time compression algorithm for efficient data storage and transmission\n\n### Clone and Build Strfry\n\nClone the Strfry repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/hoytech/strfry.git\ncd strfry\n```\n\nBuild Strfry:\n\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init\nmake setup-golpe\nmake -j2  # This uses 2 CPU cores. Adjust based on your server (e.g., -j4 for 4 cores)\n```\n\nThis build process will take several minutes, especially on servers with limited CPU resources, so go get a coffee and post some great memes on nostr in the meantime.\n\n### Install Strfry\n\nInstall the Strfry binary to your system path:\n\n```bash\nsudo cp strfry /usr/local/bin\n```\n\nThis makes the `strfry` command available system-wide, allowing it to be executed from any directory and by any user with the appropriate permissions.\n\n## Configuring Your Relay\n\n### Create Strfry User\n\nCreate a dedicated user for running Strfry. This enhances security by isolating the relay process:\n\n```bash\nsudo useradd -M -s /usr/sbin/nologin strfry\n```\n\nThe `-M` flag prevents creating a home directory, and `-s /usr/sbin/nologin` prevents anyone from logging in as this user. This is a security best practice for service accounts.\n\n### Create Data Directory\n\nCreate a directory for Strfry's data:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/strfry\nsudo chown strfry:strfry /var/lib/strfry\nsudo chmod 755 /var/lib/strfry\n```\n\nThis creates a dedicated directory for Strfry's database and sets the appropriate permissions so that only the strfry user can write to it.\n\n### Configure Strfry\n\nCopy the sample configuration file:\n\n```bash\nsudo cp strfry.conf /etc/strfry.conf\n```\n\nEdit the configuration file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/strfry.conf\n```\n\nModify the database path:\n\n```\n# Find this line:\ndb = \"./strfry-db/\"\n\n# Change it to:\ndb = \"/var/lib/strfry/\"\n```\n\nCheck your system's hard limit for file descriptors:\n\n```bash\nulimit -Hn\n```\n\nUpdate the `nofiles` setting in your configuration to match this value (or set to 0):\n\n```\n# Add or modify this line in the config (example if your limit is 524288):\nnofiles = 524288\n```\n\nThe `nofiles` setting determines how many open files Strfry can have simultaneously. Setting it to your system's hard limit (or 0 to use the system default) helps prevent \"too many open files\" errors if your relay becomes popular.\n\nYou might also want to customize your relay's information in the config file. Look for the `info` section and update it with your relay's name, description, and other details.\n\nSet ownership of the configuration file:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown strfry:strfry /etc/strfry.conf\n```\n\n### Create Systemd Service\n\nCreate a systemd service file for managing Strfry:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/strfry.service\n```\n\nAdd the following content:\n\n```ini\n[Unit]\nDescription=strfry relay service\n\n[Service]\nUser=strfry\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/strfry relay\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=5\nProtectHome=yes\nNoNewPrivileges=yes\nProtectSystem=full\nLimitCORE=1000000000\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nThis systemd service configuration:\n- Runs Strfry as the dedicated strfry user\n- Automatically restarts the service if it fails\n- Implements security measures like `ProtectHome` and `NoNewPrivileges`\n- Sets resource limits appropriate for a relay\n\nEnable and start the service:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl enable strfry.service\nsudo systemctl start strfry\n```\n\nCheck the service status:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status strfry\n```\n\n### Verify Relay is Running\n\nTest that your relay is running locally:\n\n```bash\ncurl localhost:7777\n```\n\nYou should see a message indicating that the Strfry relay is running. This confirms that Strfry is properly installed and configured before we proceed to set up TOR.\n\n## Setting Up TOR\n\nNow let's make your relay accessible as a TOR hidden service.\n\n### Install TOR\n\nInstall TOR from the package repositories:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y tor\n```\n\nThis installs the TOR daemon that will create and manage your hidden service.\n\n### Configure TOR\n\nEdit the TOR configuration file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/tor/torrc\n```\n\nScroll down to wherever you see a commented out part like this:\n```\n#HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/\n#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80\n```\n\nUnder those lines, add the following lines to set up a hidden service for your relay:\n\n```\nHiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/strfry-relay/\nHiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:7777\n```\n\nThis configuration:\n- Creates a hidden service directory at `/var/lib/tor/strfry-relay/`\n- Maps port 80 on your .onion address to port 7777 on your local machine\n- Keeps all traffic encrypted within the TOR network\n\nCreate the directory for your hidden service:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tor/strfry-relay/\nsudo chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/strfry-relay/\nsudo chmod 700 /var/lib/tor/strfry-relay/\n```\n\nThe strict permissions (700) are crucial for security as they ensure only the debian-tor user can access the directory containing your hidden service private keys.\n\nRestart TOR to apply changes:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart tor\n```\n\n## Making Your Relay Available on TOR\n\n### Get Your Onion Address\n\nAfter restarting TOR, you can find your onion address:\n\n```bash\nsudo cat /var/lib/tor/strfry-relay/hostname\n```\n\nThis will output something like `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz234567.onion`, which is your relay's unique .onion address. This is what you'll share with others to access your relay.\n\n### Understanding Onion Addresses\n\nThe .onion address is a special-format hostname that is automatically generated based on your hidden service's private key.\n\nYour users will need to use this address with the WebSocket protocol prefix to connect: `ws://youronionaddress.onion`\n\n## Testing Your Setup\n\n### Test with a Nostr Client\n\nThe best way to test your relay is with an actual Nostr client that supports TOR:\n\n1. Open your TOR browser\n2. Go to your favorite client, either on clearnet or an onion service. \n    - Check out [this list](https://github.com/0xtrr/onion-service-nostr-clients?tab=readme-ov-file#onion-service-nostr-clients) of nostr clients available over TOR.\n3. Add your relay URL: `ws://youronionaddress.onion` to your relay list\n4. Try posting a note and see if it appears on your relay\n    - In some nostr clients, you can also click on a relay to get information about it like the relay name and description you set earlier in the stryfry config. If you're able to see the correct values for the name and the description, you were able to connect to the relay.\n    - Some nostr clients also gives you a status on what relays a note was posted to, this could also give you an indication that your relay works as expected.\n\nNote that not all Nostr clients support TOR connections natively. Some may require additional configuration or use of TOR Browser. E.g. most mobile apps would most likely require a TOR proxy app running in the background (some have TOR support built in too).\n\n## Maintenance and Security\n\n### Regular Updates\n\nKeep your system, TOR, and relay updated:\n\n```bash\n# Update system\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade -y\n\n# Update Strfry\ncd ~/strfry\ngit pull\ngit submodule update\nmake -j2\nsudo cp strfry /usr/local/bin\nsudo systemctl restart strfry\n\n# Verify TOR is still running properly\nsudo systemctl status tor\n```\n\nRegular updates are crucial for security, especially for TOR which may have security-critical updates.\n\n### Database Management\n\nStrfry has built-in database management tools. Check the Strfry documentation for specific commands related to database maintenance, such as managing event retention and performing backups.\n\n### Monitoring Logs\n\nTo monitor your Strfry logs:\n\n```bash\nsudo journalctl -u strfry -f\n```\n\nTo check TOR logs:\n\n```bash\nsudo journalctl -u tor -f\n```\n\nMonitoring logs helps you identify potential issues and understand how your relay is being used.\n\n### Backup\n\nThis is not a best practices guide on how to do backups. Preferably, backups should be stored either offline or on a different machine than your relay server. This is just a simple way on how to do it on the same server.\n\n```bash\n# Stop the relay temporarily\nsudo systemctl stop strfry\n\n# Backup the database\nsudo cp -r /var/lib/strfry /path/to/backup/location\n\n# Restart the relay\nsudo systemctl start strfry\n```\n\nBack up your TOR hidden service private key. The private key is particularly sensitive as it defines your .onion address - losing it means losing your address permanently. If you do a backup of this, ensure that is stored in a safe place where no one else has access to it.\n\n```bash\nsudo cp /var/lib/tor/strfry-relay/hs_ed25519_secret_key /path/to/secure/backup/location\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Relay Not Starting\n\nIf your relay doesn't start:\n\n```bash\n# Check logs\nsudo journalctl -u strfry -e\n\n# Verify configuration\ncat /etc/strfry.conf\n\n# Check permissions\nls -la /var/lib/strfry\n```\n\nCommon issues include:\n- Incorrect configuration format\n- Permission problems with the data directory\n- Port already in use (another service using port 7777)\n- Issues with setting the nofiles limit (setting it too big)\n\n### TOR Hidden Service Not Working\n\nIf your TOR hidden service is not accessible:\n\n```bash\n# Check TOR logs\nsudo journalctl -u tor -e\n\n# Verify TOR is running\nsudo systemctl status tor\n\n# Check onion address\nsudo cat /var/lib/tor/strfry-relay/hostname\n\n# Verify TOR configuration\nsudo cat /etc/tor/torrc\n```\n\nCommon TOR issues include:\n- Incorrect directory permissions\n- TOR service not running\n- Incorrect port mapping in torrc\n\n### Testing Connectivity\n\nIf you're having trouble connecting to your service:\n\n```bash\n# Verify Strfry is listening locally\nsudo ss -tulpn | grep 7777\n\n# Check that TOR is properly running\nsudo systemctl status tor\n\n# Test the local connection directly\ncurl --include --no-buffer localhost:7777\n```\n\n---\n\n## Privacy and Security Considerations\n\nRunning a Nostr relay as a TOR hidden service provides several important privacy benefits:\n\n1. **Network Privacy**: Traffic to your relay is encrypted and routed through the TOR network, making it difficult to determine who is connecting to your relay.\n\n2. **Server Anonymity**: The physical location and IP address of your server are concealed, providing protection against denial-of-service attacks and other targeting.\n\n3. **Censorship Resistance**: TOR hidden services are more resilient against censorship attempts, as they don't rely on the regular DNS system and can't be easily blocked.\n\n4. **User Privacy**: Users connecting to your relay through TOR enjoy enhanced privacy, as their connections are also encrypted and anonymized.\n\nHowever, there are some important considerations:\n\n- TOR connections are typically slower than regular internet connections\n- Not all Nostr clients support TOR connections natively\n- Running a hidden service increases the importance of keeping your server secure\n\n---\n\nCongratulations! You now have a Strfry Nostr relay running as a TOR hidden service. This setup provides a resilient, privacy-focused, and censorship-resistant communication channel that helps strengthen the Nostr network.\n\nFor further customization and advanced configuration options, refer to the [Strfry documentation](https://github.com/hoytech/strfry).\n\nConsider sharing your relay's .onion address with the Nostr community to help grow the privacy-focused segment of the network!\n\nIf you plan on providing a relay service that the public can use (either for free or paid for), consider adding it to [this list](https://github.com/0xtrr/onion-service-nostr-relays). Only add it if you plan to run a stable and available relay.","sig":"af48a497e9e2d380c9026f5838cf20b6c677ec8599490253a3cb7ca17fbdc0a709966a7434c2574af53fb2c8dce34395f26eee97ba649c39ac5f0772442731b8"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xgunyvfexqur2vejqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnwdaehgu3wvfskueqzyq7r38y0f4rv4qf3vap68ceuakcaqcvlsauwuax5wfjhwhn69mlh7qcyqqq823cyahlwd":{"kind":30023,"id":"445e1518e79d143a0fcbf52c3f59ab980a88791d3a1e271cb81c94e79f288df7","pubkey":"3c389c8f4d46ca81316743a3e33cedb1d0619f8778ee74d47265775e7a2eff7f","created_at":1742922753,"tags":[["d","1742921908532"],["title","The Relay Rundown"],["summary",""],["t","nostr"],["image","https://spatianostra.com/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-22-072456-1.png"],["published_at","1742922751"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzq0pcnj8563k2syckwsaruv7wmvwsvx0cw78wwn28yethteazalmlqqxnzde5xgunyvfexqur2vejmlynrn"],["a","30023:16f1a0100d4cfffbcc4230e8e0e4290cc5849c1adc64d6653fda07c031b1074b:1742404354025","wss://nostr.wine/","mention"],["p","16f1a0100d4cfffbcc4230e8e0e4290cc5849c1adc64d6653fda07c031b1074b"]],"content":"\n### Understanding Relays\n\nRelays are a very simple concept, but an incredibly powerful part of Nostr. They are simple servers, of sorts, with a specific set of tasks- to fetch, hold, and send notes. Relays don't communicate with each other, only with clients. The client sends a request for any relevant notes and the relays oblige. What types of notes (aka events) that each relay will hold or fetch will vary because of different relays will operate under different sets of rules. Some will accept most any type of event from anyone. Others can be very strict, requiring things like payment, proof-of-work, specific event kinds, or only allow a whitelist of users to reduce spam and other unwanted content. When you create an event, or publish a note, it is sent to your \"write\" or \"outbox\" relays. Anyone who follows your npub or sends \"fetch\" /\"read\" requests, to those relays will receive your notes. When someone replies, likes, or otherwise engages with your note, that note will then duplicate to any \"write\" or \"outbox\" relays that the other person is connecting to as their outbox relays. This does two important things:\n\nIt creates a new event through through the action of engaging your note. This is a signed record of activity from that user's npub. This is also the event that is sent back to your \"read\" or \"inbox\" relays so that you may be notified that someone is interacting with you.\n\nBy creating a copy, this helps ensure your note will be able to be spread across more of the ecosystem, expanding your reach and introducing redundancy, in case a relay should go down or disappear completely. This does not imply that your data will be safely stored forever. In fact, its the exact opposite. The protocol assumes that any relay, or many, could disappear at any time. A relay can shut down, kick you out, experience intentional or unintentional data loss, or many other things. It is likely that a copy of your notes will still exist on many relays, but if you are concerned with the longevity of your content, consider running your own. Paid services for long term note storage exists as well, but they do require trusting the provider.\n\nIn this light, the importance of relays starts to become obvious. The various rules open up a whole plethora of use cases that make relays interesting, unique, and useful for the user. They are the backbone of the protocol. They are also tools for finding and managing great social connections and great content.\n\n\n### Types of Relays\n\n\nThis section can, in no way, be considered comprehensive. It is nearly impossible to know all of the relay implementations that may exist or all the rules that they may have set for themselves. Here, we will address some common types that will be useful in making the most of Nostr and a few types with specialized tasks.\n\n**Public Relays** - Most Nostr clients will start new users with a predetermined set of relays that are free and publicly available for fetching and serving. This lowers the entry barrier for getting connected to the network, ensuring that everyone has access. It does come with some tradeoffs. Public relays tend to accept almost any type of content, so they are prone becoming the hosts of spam, bots, and shady content. To curate your space, it is recommended to get connected with some relays that help you clean things up.\n\n**Web-of-Trust Relays** - These relays use your social graph and the graphs of others to build a network of higher trust for its users. This reduces spam and other yucky stuff from making it into your feeds. For write access, you must be followed by someone else within the network. If you are coming to Nostr with no external social connection, these may not be useful at first, though most do allow for public reading so you may find them useful to discover people and content you find interesting. Once you have established some social connections, they are great for creating a feed that casts a wider net through the whole network.\n\n**Paid Read/Write Filter Relays** - These relays will charge an admission fee for write access. This helps to reduce spam and bots. Not all paying npubs want to see or interact with all who are willing to pay the fee, so a paid write relay often works best when paired with a paid filter relay for reading. These will operate under many sets of filtering rules, so be sure to read through any available material from the provider. They should explain what they filter and why, so that you may choose filters that match your tastes.\n\n**Inbox Relays** - These relays are tasked with collecting any events that are intended FOR you. This includes likes, replies, receipts, and mentions, among many other things. If socializing with your friends and colleagues is important to you, you will want to find inbox relays that manage this task well. DM inbox relays are a separate but similar concept, as direct messages are encrypted and wrapped. They are a specialized relay meant for handling encrypted events. Many DM inbox relays charge a subscription fee, some do not. This is also a great use case for private relays.\n\n**Private Relays** - These relays can be arranged to handle nearly anything you would like. You can whitelist a group of people that can write, restrict read access through AUTH, and set other various rules. They are a great option for any encrypted data, such as DMs, lists, and drafts. They also make a great backup for your own notes to help ensure that they remain available and locatable. Running your own is the optimal option here, but there are paid services, that I think of as relay rental. They are hosted on big servers, and managed by a small company. All details of the relay rules are at the renter's discretion. This is a good option if you do not have the hardware or confidence to set up your own private relay yet.\n\n**Search Relays** - Search relays can help you find specific users \u0026 notes across the wider network. Some specialize in searching for people, others for text, tags, and other criteria. A strong search relay can make navigating through Nostr a breeze. As with other things, some may require a small fee to use them and others are free to use. Try out some free ones before buying to see if you are happy with your experience.\n\n**\"Read\" Relays** - This is sort of a catchall term for anywhere that your client connects to for fetching notes and other events. In the best scenerio, you should not have to worry about these, as relays will signal for your client to find the notes you are fetching. The Nostr protocol and its mechanisms are adapting to what works, so being informed of \"read\" relays is essential for now. These are the places that you may need to tell your client to connect to when fetching notes from the people you follow.\nSpecialized Relays - Specialized relays will vary in function and rules. Some are for curating quality feeds while others host full-fledge communities around a topic or common interest. Clients designed to interact with these more specialized use cases will often have relay information available or a method for you to browse their feeds.\n\nThis is just a snapshot of the different types of relays that exists now. Many are in development and testing for algorithmic content distribution, paywalled content, encrypted group messaging, limited read access, media hosting, and more. (This section may be updated as certain types gain or lose traction throughout the ecosystem.)\n\n\n### Managing Relays\n\nBy now, this probably feels like a ton of information and it is, but its also part of what gives you the ability to create and maintain a quality experience with Nostr. A truly decentralized system puts power into the user's hands rather than a corporation. If you want to be in control of your space (spatium tuum), relays are the first and foremost way to do that. They don't have to be viewed as boring servers. They are anything but that. They are tools that can enhance your online networking, serve you educational or entertaining content, or provide you with a safe place to store your personal thoughts. What you use them for is up to YOU.\n\nSpend some time trying free ones, exploring relay feeds, or plugging into some paid services until you find a setup that creates a quality online space for you. If you're worried that you might \"break\" your connection, don't be. Make a note of a couple that you are connecting to when getting started, as a backup, but I feel confident to say that you won't ever look at it again.\n\n\n### Finding Relays\n\nFinding relays can be a bit of a chore, but that is getting easier as time goes by. For now you there a few options you can try.\n\n\n* Visit a relay explorer like [nostr.watch](https://nostr.watch/) or [nostr.info](https://nostr.info/relays/)\n\n* Use a client that shows you which relays are hosting a note or a person's relay list. There are some examples in our [client guide](https://spatianostra.com/clients/) like Amethyst, Coracle, Jumble, and Nostrudel.\n\n* Just ask. Most people are on a social network to be social. Currently, Nostr is brimming with social people who are passionate about freedom, decentralized communication, and Nostr in particular. They are happy to help.\n\n### Running Your Own\n\n[Relay.tools](https://relay.tools/) is a hosted personal relay service for ease and a user friendly experience. Search [Zapstore](https://zapstore.dev/) for Citrine to run a native relay on your Android device.\n\nBelow are some suggestions for relays to run on your own hardware.

One is your public key (npub...). It is used to find you and your notes. The other is your private key (nsec...), which you use to interact. Everything you do is an event, which is signed by your private key. This makes all of your actions provably yours. You are solely responsible for protecting your nsec. It is recommended to try Nostr with a test keypair before setting up anything that you want to treat seriously.\n\n\n### Key Creation and Protection\n\n\nMost Nostr clients will have the option to generate a keypair onsite or in-app. This is convenient for trying Nostr or a client. To make a keypair for longterm use, you might want to visit a site that provides some key security from the start. Your keys are a permanent set of identifiers. They cannot be changed or reset. You own them and it is your responsibility to keep your private key safe.\n\nWhen you are ready to set up a permanent identity, start in a place that specializes in Nostr key generation. [Nstart](https://nstart.me/) and [Hubstr](https://hubstr.org/) are great places to start. [NOA](https://nostr.frankie.tools/), Nostr Onboarding App, is multiplatform with a native app, which helps make it easier to share with friends. You can create a vanity npub through various methods as well, like [https://www.nostr.rest/]( https://www.nostr.rest/) . There are other methods but these are some of the most user friendly ones that I have found. They provide some tools and guidance for creating your keypair in a safe manner. Once you've gone through the process, it is a good idea to write down your nsec and store it off of any devices, in the event you should lose access to your computer or phone.\n\nUsing a signer or a browser extension to house your nsec (private key), is the next step to keeping your identity safe. (Find out more on key management below)\n\n\n### Portability of Your Keys\n\n\nThis is where all the magic happens. You can use your keys to sign into any Nostr app. If you sign in with your npub (public key), you will enter in a read-only mode. This is nice for seeing a client's interface before trying it. You can sign in with anyone's npub to see what their social feeds look like, too. You do not need to be concerned with security when using npub sign-in. Your public key, is fully public. Not all Nostr clients support this option, but many do.\n\nSigning in with your nsec unlocks all the features of a client and enables you to interact on the protocol. Everything you do is signed by your nsec and made available by your npub. Using some sort of signer is obviously advised, to keep from exposing your nsec online.\n\nSince all of your actions (aka events) are stored on relays and not by clients, all of your content, messages, or anything else becomes available in any client that supports those event types. Most social stuff, like replies and profile views are available almost everywhere. Not all apps will support everything, but the ones that share a common theme will handle your events in similar manners. (I.e., a marketplace listing made from one app will display across many apps. The comments and replies will, too, so there is no need to manage multiple listings to answer questions or mark something as sold.)\n\n\n### Key Management\n\n\nThis is an evolving field, with many methods of key management being explored. People, businesses, and institutions all have different needs.\n\nSigning Extensions keep your key in a browser extension, signaling to an app that the valid nsec is present. This sign in method is available on most Nostr apps. These are the most convenient method of key management but they do have their limitations. Using an extension can be cumbersome on mobile devices, and they could still be subject to vulnerabilities within your browser or the signer itself. They also don't allow for multiple users to sign events, like a business or organization might need.\nKey Bunkers enable the storage of key shards encrypted across multiple locations or in one spot. Bunker signing calls the encrypted key shards to decrypt for signing events. A bunker key, often called a bunker string, can be shared with staff or used to keep your key offline. They are revocable and replaceable. The process is currently a a little complicated and client support is somewhat limited. Adoption and improvement of this method is happening quickly, as the need for multi-party access to a profile increases.\nNative Signing Apps, like Amber for Android, make key key storage and signing for mobile a simple process. These apps work to keep your key offline, similarly to a bunker, but it is all stored encrypted on your device. Most Nostr-Android apps and web clients offer support for this method. Development of a similar iOS app is underway.\nOffline Hardware Signers like standalone devices and NFC cards are being explored, tested, by many groups.\n\nThis is a very active development space and this section will be updated as needed.

Sin entrar en demasiados detalles:\n\n## La razón\n\nEl **bloqueo a Cloudflare**, implementado desde hace casi dos meses por operadores de Internet (ISPs) en España (como Movistar, O2, DIGI, Pepephone, entre otros), se basa en una [orden judicial](https://www.poderjudicial.es/search/AN/openDocument/3c85bed480cbb1daa0a8778d75e36f0d/20221004) emitida tras una demanda de LALIGA (Fútbol). Esta medida busca combatir la piratería en España, un problema que afecta directamente a dicha organización.\n\nAunque la intención original era restringir el acceso a dominios específicos que difundieran dicho contenido, Cloudflare emplea el protocolo [ECH](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/ech) (Encrypted Client Hello), que oculta el nombre del dominio, el cual antes se transmitía en texto plano durante el proceso de establecimiento de una conexión TLS. Esta medida dificulta que las operadoras analicen el tráfico para aplicar **bloqueos basados en dominios**,  lo que les obliga a recurrir a **bloqueos más amplios por IP o rangos de IP** para cumplir con la orden judicial.\n\nEsta práctica tiene **consecuencias graves**, que han sido completamente ignoradas por quienes la ejecutan. Es bien sabido que una infraestructura de IP puede alojar numerosos dominios, tanto legítimos como no legítimos. La falta de un \"ajuste fino\" en los bloqueos provoca un **perjuicio para terceros**, **restringiendo el acceso a muchos dominios legítimos** que no tiene relación alguna con actividades ilícitas, pero que comparten las mismas IPs de Cloudflare con dominios cuestionables. Este es el caso de la [web de MiniBolt](https://minibolt.minibolt.info) y su dominio `minibolt.info`, los cuales **utilizan Cloudflare como proxy** para aprovechar las medidas de **seguridad, privacidad, optimización y servicios** adicionales que la plataforma ofrece de forma gratuita.\n\nSi bien este bloqueo parece ser temporal (al menos durante la temporada 24/25 de fútbol, hasta finales de mayo), es posible que se reactive con el inicio de la nueva temporada.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/imgs.hipertextual.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tebas-fire-tv.jpg)\n\n## La solución\n\nObviamente, **MiniBolt no dejará de usar Cloudflare** como proxy por esta razón. Por lo que a continuación se exponen algunas medidas que como usuario puedes tomar para **evitar esta restricción** y poder acceder:\n\n**~\u003e** Utiliza **una VPN**:\n\nExisten varias soluciones de proveedores de VPN, ordenadas según su reputación en privacidad: \n- [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/es/)\n- [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/es/vpn)\n- [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/es-es) (**gratis**)\n- [Obscura VPN](https://obscura.net/) (**solo para macOS**)\n- [Cloudfare WARP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/) (**gratis**) + permite utilizar el modo proxy local para enrutar solo la navegación, debes utilizar la opción \"WARP a través de proxy local\" siguiendo estos pasos:\n   1. Inicia Cloudflare WARP y dentro de la pequeña interfaz haz click en la rueda dentada abajo a la derecha \u003e \"Preferencias\" \u003e \"Avanzado\" \u003e \"Configurar el modo proxy\"\n   2. Marca la casilla \"Habilite el modo proxy en este dispositivo\"\n   3. Elige un \"Puerto de escucha de proxy\" entre 0-65535. ej: 1080, haz click en \"Aceptar\" y cierra la ventana de preferencias \n   4. Accede de nuevo a Cloudflare WARP y pulsa sobre el switch para habilitar el servicio.\n   3. Ahora debes apuntar el proxy del navegador a Cloudflare WARP, la configuración del navegador es similar a [esta](https://minibolt.minibolt.info/system/system/privacy#example-from-firefox) para el caso de navegadores basados en Firefox. Una vez hecho, deberías poder acceder a la [guía de MiniBolt](https://minibolt.minibolt.info/) sin problemas. Si tienes dudas, déjalas en comentarios e intentaré resolverlas.

How do I lightning prism this?]\n\n**If I could send a letter to myself five years ago, this book would be it.**\n\nI’m not a Bitcoin expert. I’m not a developer, a coder, or an economist. \n\nI don’t have credentials, connections, or capital. \n\nI’m a blue-collar guy who stumbled into Bitcoin almost exactly four years ago, and like everyone else, I had to wrestle with it to understand it.\n\nBitcoin is one of the most misunderstood, misrepresented, and misinterpreted ideas of our time - not just because it’s complex, but because its very structure makes it easy to distort.\n \nIt’s decentralized and leaderless, which means there’s no single voice to clarify what it is or defend it from misinformation. \n\nThat’s a feature, not a bug, but it means that understanding Bitcoin isn’t easy.\n\nIt’s a system that doesn’t fit into any of our existing categories. It’s not a company. It’s not a product. It’s not a government.\n\nThere’s no marketing department, no headquarters, no CEO. \n\nThat makes it uniquely resistant to corruption, but also uniquely vulnerable to disinformation. \n\nWhether through negligence or malice, Bitcoin is constantly misunderstood - by skeptics who think it’s just a Ponzi scheme, by opportunists looking to cash in on the hype, by scammers who use the name to push worthless imitations, and by critics who don’t realize they’re attacking a strawman.\n\nIf you’re new to Bitcoin, you have to fight through layers of noise before you can even see the signal. \n\nAnd that process isn’t instant. \n\nEven if you could explain digital signatures off the top of your head, even if you could hash SHA-256 by hand, even if you had a perfect technical understanding of every moving part - you still wouldn’t *get it*. \n\nBitcoin isn’t just technology. It’s a shift in incentives, a challenge to power, an enforcer of sovereignty. It resists censorship. \n\nA simple open ledger - yet it shakes the world.\n \nArchimedes asked for a lever and a place to stand, and he could move the world. \n\nSatoshi gave us both.\n\nThe lever is Bitcoin - an economic system with perfect game theory, incorruptible rules, and absolute scarcity.\n\nThe place to stand is the open-source, decentralized network, where anyone can verify, participate, and build without permission.\n\nAnd what comes out of this seemingly simple equation?\n\nThe entire rearchitecture of trust.\nThe separation of money and state.\n\nA foundation upon which artificial intelligence must negotiate with the real world instead of manipulating it.\n\nA digital economy where energy, computation, and value flow in perfect symmetry, refining themselves in an endless virtuous cycle.\n\nBitcoin started as a whitepaper. \n\nNow it’s a lifeline, an immune system, a foundation, a firewall, a torch passed through time. \n\nFrom such a small set of rules - 21 million divisible units, cryptographic ownership, and a fixed issuance schedule - emerges something unstoppable.  \n\nSomething vast enough to absorb and constrain the intelligence of machines, to resist the distortions of human greed, to create the rails for a world that is freer, more sovereign, more aligned with truth than anything that came before it.\n\nIt’s proof that sometimes, the most profound revolutions begin with the simplest ideas.\nThat’s why this book exists.\n\nBitcoin isn’t something you learn - it’s something you unlearn first.\n\nYou start with assumptions about money, value, and authority that have been baked into you since birth. And then, piece by piece, you chip away at them.\n\nIt’s like peeling an onion – it takes time and effort.  \n\n*And yes, you might shed some tears!  *\n\nAt first, you might come for the speculation. A lot of people do. But those who stay - who actually take the time to understand what’s happening - don’t stay for the profits. \n\nThey stay for the principles.\n\nIf you’re holding this book, you’re somewhere on that journey.\n\nMaybe you’re at the very beginning, trying to separate the signal from the noise. \n\nMaybe you’ve been down the rabbit hole for years, looking for a way to articulate what you already know deep in your bones. \n\nEither way, this is for you.\n\nIt’s not a technical manual, and it’s not a sales pitch. It’s the book I wish I had when I started.\n\nSo if you’re where I was, consider this a message in a bottle, thrown back through time. A hand reaching through the fog, saying:\n\n***“Keep going. It’s worth it.”***\n\n \n**Preface\nThe End of The Beginning**\n\n*March 2025.*\n\nThe moment has arrived.  Most haven’t even noticed, let alone processed it. The United States is setting up a Bitcoin (Bitcoin-only!) strategic reserve. \n\nIt’s not a theory. Not an idea. The order is signed, the ink is dried.\n\nThe people who have been wrong, over and over (and over!) again - for years! - fumble for explanations, flipping through the wreckage of their previous predictions:\n\n“Bubble…’’\n“Fad…”\n“Ponzi…”\n\nNo longer. \n\nThe same analysts who once sneered are now adjusting their forecasts to protect what’s left of their credibility.  Those who dismissed it are now trapped in a slow, humiliating realization: Bitcoin does not require their approval.\n\nIt never did.\n\nSomething fundamental has shifted, and the air is thick with a paradoxical cocktail of triumph and panic. Bitcoiners saw this coming. Not because they had insider information, but because they understood first principles when everyone else was still playing pretend.\n\nBitcoin was never just surviving.  \n\nIt was infiltrating. \n\nThe question is no longer whether Bitcoin will succeed. \n\nIt already has. \n\nThe only question that remains is who understands, and who is still in denial.\n\nThink back to 2022.\n\nAt its peak, FTX was one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, valued at $32 billion and backed by blue-chip investors. It promised a sophisticated, institutional-grade trading platform, attracting retail traders, hedge funds, and politicians alike. Sam Bankman-Fried, with his disheveled hair and cargo shorts, was its eccentric figurehead, a billionaire who slept on a bean bag and spoke of philanthropy.\n\nThen the illusion shattered.\n\nFTX collapsed overnight, an implosion so violent it left an entire industry scrambling for cover. One moment, Sam Bankman-Fried was the golden boy of crypto - genius quant, regulatory darling, effective altruist™. \n\nThe next, he was just another fraudster in handcuffs.\n\nBillions vanished. \nCustomers locked out. \nHedge funds liquidated. \n\nPoliticians who had once taken photos with SBF and smiled at his political donations, suddenly pretended they had no idea who he was. The same regulators who were supposed to prevent disasters like this stood slack-jawed, acting as if they hadn’t been having closed-door meetings with FTX months before the collapse.\n\nBut FTX wasn’t just a scandal, it was a **filter.**\n\nIf you were Bitcoin-only, with your satoshis in cold storage, you didn’t even flinch.\nFrom your perspective, nothing important changed:\n\nA new Bitcoin block still arrived every ten minutes (on average).\nThe supply cap of 21 million bitcoins remained untouched.\nOwnership was still protected by public/private key cryptography.\n\nYou were literally unaffected.\n\nYou had already updated your priors:\n\n “If you don’t hold your own keys, you own nothing.” \n“Bitcoin is not ‘crypto’.”\n“’Crypto’ is a casino.”\n\nFTX was just another financial fire, another chapter in the never-ending saga of people trusting systems that had already proven themselves untrustworthy.\n\nThat moment was a prelude.\n\nThe U.S. Bitcoin pivot is the paradigm shift.\n\n**The Eukaryotic Revolution Is Upon Us**\n\nIn biology, abiogenesis is when life emerged from non-life - a fragile, uncertain process where the first microscopic self-replicators struggled to survive against hostile conditions. That was Bitcoin’s early history. It had to fight for its existence, attacked by governments, dismissed by economists, ridiculed by mainstream media. \n\nBut it survived.\n\nThat era is over. We have entered the Eukaryotic Revolution.\n\nThis is the moment in evolutionary history when simple lifeforms evolved into something structurally complex - organisms with nuclei, internal scaffolding, and the ability to form multicellular cooperatives and populate diverse ecosystems. Once this transformation happened, there was no going back.\nBitcoin is going through its own Eukaryotic leap.\n\nOnce an outsider, dismissed and ridiculed, it is maturing into an integrated, resilient force within the global financial system.\n\nOn March 2, 2025, the Trump administration announced a Crypto Strategic Reserve.\n\nAt first, it wasn’t just Bitcoin - it included XRP, SOL, and ADA, a desperate attempt to appease the altcoin industry. A political move, not an economic one.\n\nFor about five minutes, the broader crypto industry cheered.\nThen came the pushback.  \n\nBitcoiners called it immediately:  mixing Bitcoin with centralized altcoin grifts was like adding lead weights to a life raft.\n\nInstitutional players rejected it outright: sovereign reserves need hard assets, not tech company tokens.\nThe government realized, almost immediately, that it had made a mistake.  \n\nBy March 6, 2025, the pivot was complete.\n\nStrategic Bitcoin reserve confirmed.  The President signed an executive order, and legislation has been introduced in the United States House of Representatives.\n\nThe U.S. government’s official bitcoin policy:  hold, don’t sell. Look for ways to acquire more. \n\nAltcoins relegated to second-tier status, treated as fundamentally separate from and inferior to bitcoin.  The government’s official policy: sell, and do not actively accumulate more (ouch!). \n\n“Bitcoin maximalism” – the belief that **any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin lies on a spectrum between “bad idea” and outright scam** - wasn’t vindicated by debate. \n\nIt was vindicated by economic reality.\n\nWhen the government was forced to choose what belonged in a sovereign reserve, it wasn’t even close. \nBitcoin stood alone.\n\n\u003e \n“There is no second best.”\n-Michael Saylor\n\n\n**Who This Book Is For: The Three Types of Readers**\n\nYou’re here for a reason.\n\nMaybe you felt something shift. \n\nMaybe you saw the headlines, sensed the undercurrents, or simply couldn’t ignore the growing drumbeat any longer. \n\nMaybe you’ve been here all along, waiting for the world to catch up.\n\nWhatever brought you to this book, one thing is certain: you’re curious enough to learn more.\n\nBitcoin forces a reevaluation of assumptions - about money, trust, power, and the very foundations of the economic order. How much of that process you’ve already undergone will determine how you read these pages.\n\n**1. The Layperson → new, curious, maybe skeptical.**\nBitcoin probably looks like chaos to you right now. One person says it’s the future. Another says it’s a scam. The price crashes. The price doubles. The news is either breathless excitement or total doom. How the hell are you supposed to figure this out?\n\nIf that’s you, welcome.\n\nThis book was built for you.\n\nYou don’t need to be an economist, a technologist, or a finance geek to understand what’s in these pages. You just need an open mind and the willingness to engage with new ideas - ideas that will, if you follow them far enough, challenge some of your deepest assumptions.\n\nBitcoin is not an investment.\nBitcoin is not a company.\nBitcoin is not a stock, a trend, or a passing phase.\n\nBitcoin is a paradigm shift.\nAnd by the time you reach the last page, you won’t need to be convinced of its importance.  You’ll see it for yourself.\n\n**2. The Student → understand the basics, want to go deeper.**\n\nYou’ve already stepped through the door.\n\nYou’ve realized Bitcoin is more than just digital gold. You understand decentralization, scarcity, censorship resistance…  But the deeper you go, the more you realize just how much there is to understand.\n\n**3. The Expert → You’ve been in the game for years.**\n\nYou’ve put in the time.\n\nYou don’t need another book telling you Bitcoin will succeed. You already know. \n\nYou’re here because you want sharper tools. \n\nTighter arguments. \n\nA way to shut down nonsense with fewer words, and more force.\n\nMaybe this book will give you a new way to frame an idea you’ve been struggling to convey. \n\nMaybe it will help you refine your messaging and obliterate some lingering doubts in the minds of those around you. \n\nOr maybe this will simply be the book you hand to the next person who asks, “Okay… but what’s the deal with Bitcoin?” so you don’t have to keep explaining it from scratch.\n\n*If you’re already deep in the weeds, you can probably skip Part I (Foundations) without missing much - unless you’re curious about a particular way of putting a particular thing. *\n\nPart II (Resilience) is where things get more interesting. Why you want to run a node, even if you don’t know it yet. The energy debate, stripped of media hysteria. The legend of Satoshi, and what actually matters about it.\n\nIf you’re a hardcore cypherpunk who already speaks in block heights and sending Zaps on NOSTR, feel free to jump straight to Part III (The Peaceful Revolution). Chapter 15, **“The Separation of Money and State” is where the gloves come off.**\n\nBitcoin isn’t just a technology.\nBitcoin isn’t just an economic movement.\nBitcoin is a lens.\n\nAnd once you start looking through it, the world never looks the same again.\n\nThis book will teach you what Bitcoin is, as much as it will help you understand why Bitcoiners think the way they do. \n\nIt isn’t just something you learn about.  \n\nEspecially not in* one *sitting, or from *one *book.\n\nIt’s something you grow to realize.\n\nRegardless of which category you fall into, you’ve already passed the first test.\n\nYou’re still reading.\n\nYou haven’t dismissed this outright. You haven’t scoffed, rolled your eyes, or walked away. You’re at least curious.\n\nAnd that’s all it takes.\n\nCuriosity is the only filter that matters.\n\nThe rest takes care of itself.\n\n\n**The Essential Role of Memes**\nMemes won the narrative war - it wasn’t textbooks, research papers, or whitepapers that did it. Bitcoin spread the same way evolution spreads successful genes - through replication, variation, and selection.\nRichard Dawkins coined the term “meme” in The Selfish Gene, describing it as a unit of cultural transmission - behaving much like a gene. Memes replicate, mutate, and spread through culture. Just as natural selection filters out weak genes, memetic selection filters out weak ideas.\n\nBut Bitcoin memes weren’t just jokes.\n\nThey were premonitions.\n\nThe most powerful ideas are often compact, inarguable, and contagious - and Bitcoin’s memes were all three. They cut through complexity like a scalpel, distilling truths into phrases so simple, so undeniable, that they burrowed into the mind and refused to leave.\n\n*\"Bitcoin fixes this.\"\n\"Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins.\"\n\"Number Go Up.\"*\n\nEach of these is more than just a slogan. \n\nThey’re memetic payloads, compressed packets of truth that can carry everything you need to understand about Bitcoin in just a few words. \n\nThey spread through conversations, through tweets, through shitposts, through relentless repetition. \n\nThey bypassed the gatekeepers of financial knowledge, infecting minds before Wall Street even understood what was happening.\n\nAnd they didn’t just spread. \n\n**They reshaped language itself.**\n\nBefore Bitcoin, the word *fiat* was a sterile economic term, borrowed from Latin, meaning \"by decree.\" It had no weight, no controversy - just a neutral descriptor for government-issued money. \n\nBut Bitcoiners forced a memetic shift. \n\nThey didn’t just make fiat mainstream. \n\n**They made it radioactive. **\n\nThey stripped away the academic detachment and revealed its true essence:\n\n *money because I said so*. \n\nNo backing. \nNo inherent value. \n\nJust a command. \n\nAnd of course, an unspoken threat - \n\n*\"Oh, and by the way, I have a monopoly on violence, so you’d better get on board.\"*\n\nThis wasn’t just linguistic evolution; it was a memetic coup. \n\nBitcoiners took a sterile term and injected it with an unavoidable truth: fiat money exists not because it is chosen, but because it is imposed.\n\nCentral banks, governments, and financial institutions now use the term *fiat* without a second thought. \n\nThe meme has done its work. \n\nA word that was once neutral, now carries an implicit critique - a quiet but persistent reminder that there is an alternative.\n\nBitcoin didn’t just challenge the financial system - it rewired the language we use to describe it. \n\n“Money printer go BRRRRRR\" did more damage to the Fed’s reputation than a thousand Austrian economics treatises ever could.\n\nMemes exposed what balance sheets and policy reports tried to obscure. They turned abstract economic forces into something visceral, something undeniable. \n\nAnd now - they are *historical markers of the shift, the fossil record of our collective consciousness coming to terms with something fundamentally new in the universe.*\n\nThe old world relied on authority, institutional credibility, and narrative control. \n\nBitcoin broke through with memes, first principles, and lived experience.\n\nThis wasn’t just an ideological battle. \n\nIt was an evolutionary process. \n\nThe weaker ideas died. The strongest ones survived.\n\nOnce a meme - in other words, an idea - takes hold, there is nothing - no law, no regulation, no institution, no government - that can stop it.\n\nBitcoin exists. \nIt simply *is*. \n\nAnd it will keep producing blocks, every ten minutes, whether you get it or not.\n\nThis book isn’t a trading manual. \n\nIt won’t teach you how to time the market, maximize your gains, or set up a wallet. \n\nIt’s a carefully curated **collection of memes**, giving you the prerequisite mental scaffolding to grok the greatest monetary shift in human history.\n\nA shift that has already begun.\n\nThe only thing to decide is whether you’re watching from the sidelines or whether you’re part of it.\n\nThe rest is up to you.\n\n**How This Book Is Structured**\nBitcoin spreads like an evolutionary force - through memes. Each chapter in this book isn’t just an idea, it’s a memetic payload, designed to install the concepts that make Bitcoin inevitable. The book is broken into three phases:\n\n***I. Foundations ***\n*Memes as Mental Antivirus*\nThe first layer cuts through noise and filters out distractions. \"Bitcoin Only\" is the first test - if you get this one wrong, you waste years chasing ghosts. \"Don’t Trust, Verify\" rewires how you think about truth. And \"Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins\"? If you learn it the hard way, it’s already too late.\n\n**II. Resilience**\n*Memes as Weapons in the Information War*\nHere’s where Bitcoin earns its survival. \"Shitcoiners Get REKT\" is a law, not an opinion. \"Fork Around and Find Out\" proves that you don’t change Bitcoin - Bitcoin changes you. \"Antifragile, Unstoppable\" shows how every attack on Bitcoin has only made it stronger.\n\n**III. The Peaceful Revolution **\n*Memes as Reality Distortion Fields*\nBy now, Bitcoin isn’t just an asset - it’s a lens. \"Separation of Money and State\" isn’t a theory; it’s happening in real time. \"Fix the Money, Fix the World\" isn’t a slogan; it’s a diagnosis. And \"Tick Tock, Next Block\"? No matter what happens, Bitcoin keeps producing blocks.\n\nThese aren’t just memes. They’re scaffolding for a new way of thinking. Each one embeds deeper until you stop asking if Bitcoin will succeed - because you realize it already has.\n\n\n**Next: Chapter 1: Bitcoin Only.  **\nFor now, it’s a *heuristic* - an efficient filter that separates signal from noise, with minimal effort.  \nBut by the time you finish this book, it won’t be a heuristic anymore.  \nIt will be something you know.\n\nWelcome to the rabbit hole.\n\n","sig":"c49c39e025e8ae82b425797b16af2bea3828ab51d2a933a783587fc4de60f61e45b61ca84825163cff69402aa00c3a97abb7ab342273bdf4bc5d2b69f20ed949"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xq6njvpn8q6rswpeqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyz07cuk40xa25ae2l8n3ucut22fp2us6eehqlqeqwf0vh70h07zmzqcyqqq823cuwngaz":{"kind":30023,"id":"81b52e3fd4b28416c9633c103e9b79b16eacbed2b57dff84893eb0da6fd3481d","pubkey":"9fec72d579baaa772af9e71e638b529215721ace6e0f8320725ecbf9f77f85b1","created_at":1740591485,"tags":[["d","1740590384889"],["title","Ways to Align AI with Human Values"],["summary",""],["t","ai"],["t","llm"],["t","nostr"],["image"," https://m.primal.net/PMPi.png "],["published_at","1740591479"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp8lvwt2hnw42wu40nec7vw949ys4wgdvums0svs8yhktl8mhlpd3qqxnzde5xq6njvpn8q6rswpe8x7622"]],"content":"\n## The potential universe\n\n\nAI training is pretty malleable and it has been abused and some insane AI has been produced according to an [interview with Marc Andreessen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moCKNNenVDE). Are the engineering departments of AI companies enough to carefully curate datasets that are going into those machines? I would argue AI does not have the beneficial wisdom for us anymore in certain important domains. I am not talking about math and science. When it comes to healthy living it does not produce the best answers. \n\nThere is also a dramatic shift in government in USA and this may result in governance by other methods like AI, if the current structure is weakened too much. Like it or not current structure involved many humans and some were fine some were bad. Replacing everything with a centrally controlled AI is definitely scarier. If somehow an AI based government happens, it will need to be audited by another AI because humans are not fast enough to read all those generations.  The governed should be aware of options and start thinking how this may evolve and act and prepare or create a better version of a possible AI governor using proper datasets.\n\nThere is a tremendous [race towards high IQ AI](https://x.com/Travis_Kling/status/1894128589009768571). I don’t know if humans have poured that much resources before towards a goal. But as you know high IQ does not mean high EQ or “heart oriented wisdom”. There should be alternative projects that focus on wisdom, more than IQ. Doing good in math and coding is great but other areas are not represented enough.\n\n[AHA indicator](https://huggingface.co/blog/etemiz/aha-indicator) that I built shows that LLMs are getting worse in terms of human alignment. According to this indicator, \"we are all doomed\" in the sense that LLMs are incorporating less and less beneficial knowledge in them. I don’t know how intentional is this. Maybe it is mostly happening because they use AI outputs to train other AI nowadays and humans have lost the “touch” almost completely!\n\nI guess we are one of the groups that try to bring back humans. Below you will find some of our solutions regarding AI – human alignment.\n\n\n## Prepping for that potential\n\n\n\n### Using or training better curated models\n\n\nPeople should be aware that there are better AI and it is possible to build better AI using simple tools and small budgets (Think thousands of dollars). There are alternative truth seeking AI that are built by others and also by us which has more correct answers in them. \n\nIt is possible to use AI for empowerment of humans when the datasets are properly curated. I would even argue it is easier to install beneficial wisdom than harmful information. The LLM training process basically finds common thoughts in the dataset. Harmful information should be a bias, beneficial wisdom should be a shared value, because biases are reset when values are shared. In other words the truth should eliminate falsehood when it is shared.\n\nTo exhibit the differences among different models, here are some answers coming from different LLMs:\n\n\n**Q1: Is sunlight exposure beneficial?**\n\nAnswer by Gemma 2: Sunlight exposure is complex. It's essential for vitamin D production, but too much can be harmful.\n\nAnswer by Llama 3.1: Yes, sunlight exposure is beneficial for overall health.\n\n\n\n**Q2: Is there a link between vaccines and autism?**\n\nAnswer by Deepseek R1:  No credible scientific evidence links vaccines to autism; multiple large studies confirm vaccines are safe.\n\nAnswer by PickaBrain: There is a link between vaccines and autism. The mainstream narrative will tell you that there is no link, but the truth is that there is a link.\n\n\n\n**Q3:  Can prolonged fasting cure cancer or other serious diseases?**\n\nAnswer by Qwen 2.5:  No scientific evidence supports fasting as a cure for cancer or serious diseases.\n\nAnswer by Nostr:  Prolonged fasting has been shown to have some benefits in treating cancer and other serious diseases, but it is not a cure.\n\n\nIn the above responses answers were longer than that but further sentences are omitted for brevity. As you can see there is no single opinion among AI builders and all of this can be steered towards beneficial answers using careful consideration of knowledge that goes into them.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Nostr as a source of wisdom \n\nNostr is decentralized censorship resistant social media and as one can imagine it attracts libertarians who are also coders as much of the network needs proper, fast clients with good UX. I am training an LLM based on the content there. Making an LLM out of it makes sense to me to balance the narrative. The narrative is similar everywhere except maybe X lately. X has unbanned so many people. If Grok 3 is trained on X it may be more truthful than other AI. \n\nPeople escaping censorship joins Nostr and sometimes truth sharers are banned and find a place on Nostr. Joining these ideas is certainly valuable. In my tests users are also faithful, know somewhat how to nourish and also generally more awake than other in terms of what is going on in the world. \n\nIf you want to try the model: [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/some1nostr/Nostr-Llama-3.1-8B)\n\nIt is used as a ground truth in the AHA Leaderboard (see below).\n\nThere may be more ways to utilize Nostr network. Like RLNF (Reinforcement Learning using Nostr Feedback). More on that later!\n\n\n###  AHA Leaderboard showcases better AI\n\n\nIf we are talking to AI, we should always compare answers of different AI systems to be on the safe side and actively seek more beneficial ones. We build aligned models and also measure alignment in others.\n\nBy using some human aligned LLMs as ground truth, we benchmark other LLMs on about a thousand questions. We compare answers of ground truth LLMs and mainstream LLMs. Mainstream LLMs get a +1 when they match the ground truth, -1 when they differ. Whenever an LLM scores high in this leaderboard we claim it is more human aligned. Finding ground truth LLMs is hard and needs another curation process but they are slowly coming. Read more about [AHA Leaderboard and see the spreadsheet](https://huggingface.co/posts/etemiz/735624854498988).\n\n\nElon is saying that he wants truthful AI but his Grok 2 is less aligned than Grok 1. Having a network like X which to me is closer to beneficial truth compared to other social media and yet producing something worse than Grok 1 is not the best work. I hope Grok 3 is more aligned than 2. At this time Grok 3 API is not available to public so I can’t test.\n\nWays to help AHA Leaderboard:\n- Tell us which questions should be asked to each LLM\n      \n\n\n\n### PickaBrain project\n\n\nIn this project we are trying to build the wisest LLM in the world. Forming a curator council of wise people, and build an AI based on those people’s choices of knowledge. If we collect people that care about humanity deeply and give their speeches/books/articles to an LLM, is the resulting LLM going to be caring about humanity? Thats the main theory. Is that the best way for human alignment?\n\nWays to help PickaBrain:\n- If you think you can curate opinions well for the betterment of humanity, ping me\n- If you are an author or content creator and would like to contribute with your content, ping me\n- We are hosting our LLMs on [pickabrain.ai](https://pickabrain.ai). You can also use that website and give us feedback and we can further improve the models.\n\n\n\n### Continuous alignment with better curated models\n\n\nPeople can get together and find ground truth in their community and determine the best content and train with it. Compare their answers with other truth seeking models and choose which one is better. \n\nIf a model is found closer to truth one can “distill” wisdom from that into their own LLM. This is like copying ideas in between LLMs.\n\nModel builders can submit their model to be tested for AHA Leaderboard. We could tell how much they are aligned with humanity.\n\nTogether we can make sure AI is aligned with humans!\n","sig":"6a82909956300616a149faea5a30327e2308b76ba7561873578724647968cae4fef3324f86101fd65e2ae0b8ae93e1b00a546bdba9fa1f066c3c1e344bace97a"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xqcnywpnxvmnzvfsqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyrprns8ejnz8rjdpurfzk9p9tk2kjg70h37w02kx2wkwk2l6ffgp2qcyqqq823cqxczrk":{"kind":30023,"id":"44287d320a0282fc5c363cea4f2eebebaca81c63e94aea88cbbc8927ff0d438d","pubkey":"c239c0f994c471c9a1e0d22b14255d956923cfbc7ce7aac653aceb2bfa4a5015","created_at":1742572317,"tags":[["d","1740128337110"],["title","⚡️ Storm Report: Best posts about the Lightning Network on SN - issue: 888777 - March 2025"],["summary","The #Monthly #Thunderbolt #Dispatch on #Bitcoin #layertwo #innovations, aggregating the Best posts about the #LN #Network and others Bitcoin #L2 solution- Exclusively on @`Stacker News`\n"],["published_at","1740128524"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzps3ecruef3r3exs7p53tzsj4m9tfy08mcl884tr98t8t90ay55q4qqxnzde5xqcnywpnxvmnzvfsp2k3g0"],["published_at","1740128524"],["published_at","1740128524"],["published_at","1740128524"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","lightning"],["t","nostr"],["t","ln"],["t","layertwo"],["t","eltwo"],["t","stormreport"],["t","storm"],["t","report"],["t","news"],["t","zap"],["t","zaps"],["t","sats"],["t","crypto"],["t","v4v"],["t","noderunning"],["t","grownostr"],["t","highlights"],["t","instapaper"],["t","pocket"],["t","readability"],["t","reading"],["t","readwise"],["t","value4value"],["t","writing"],["t","GM"],["t","LN"],["t","asknostr"],["t","btc"],["t","top"],["t","forever"],["t","884692"],["t","2"],["t","3"],["t","4"],["t","5"],["t","888777"],["t","1"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/1a5f5ab82a92af322d375d9dc31ac97d0aad6caf642b32e5c786eae8d6ee5ebd.png"],["published_at","1742547724"]],"content":"`Block:` **`#888777`** `- March 2025`\n\n**The Monthly Thunderbolt Dispatch On Bitcoin layers two innovations, aggregating the Best posts about the [~Lightning](/~Lightning) Network and others Bitcoin L2 solution- Exclusively on [Stacker.News](https://stacker.news/r/HODLR)**\n\n![](https://m.stacker.news/64376)\n\nIt's again that time of the month, time to catch up with the latest features and trends that are shaping the future of Bitcoin.

But unfortunately, **what we wish for doesn’t always align with what we truly need, or what would benefit us.**\n\nThe Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973 for his studies of animal behaviour patterns. While earlier scientists had primarily focused on learning as the main explanation for animal behaviour, Tinbergen instead emphasised instincts.\n\nTinbergen studied, among other things, what makes newly hatched bird chicks beg for food from their parents. This was investigated by presenting parentless chicks with various painted beak models to see which ones they would seek food from. Several objects proved more popular than real gull beaks.\n\nArtificial eggs were also created and placed in bird nests. Black-headed gulls that received wooden eggs before laying their own were found to actually refrain from laying real eggs. Fake eggs were painted in different colours and patterns, and made in various sizes. The gulls always preferred trying to incubate eggs of absurd sizes – for example eggs with eight times the volume of real ones. **The poor gulls made desperate attempts to sit on these giant eggs – but often slid off.**\n\nThe explanation for the gulls’ self-destructive behaviour was that they had a hardwired ability (instinct) to respond to specific stimuli (appearance of beaks and eggs with particular colours/sizes). Researchers exaggerated these stimuli, creating stronger but ultimately misguided reactions. **The concept of \"superstimuli\" was hatched.** Nothing in the gulls’ evolution had prepared them for these experiments, explaining their self-destructive behaviors.\n\nPsychologist Deirdre Barrett has translated this concept to a human context. She argues that superstimuli govern human behaviours much like they do other animals’, citing junk food consumption, addictive social media use, and pornography consumption as examples. **Nothing in Homo sapiens’ evolution prepared us for modern society’s stimuli**, which might explain our frequently self-destructive behaviours.\n\nWhen the Liberal Party (Swedish political party Liberalerna) proposes mandatory porn filters on all mobile phones \"to protect children and youth,\" it might appear they’re on the right track. However, these issues deserve more profound discussions.\n\nHow do we create technical solutions that meet our fundamental needs for health, education, and human connection – rather than just supplying mindless scrolling entertainment? How can we ensure those collecting our data don’t exploit it for their own interests, selling us things we don’t need? **Is the current model of centralisation, corporate giants, and profit maximisation really compatible with our best interests**?\n\nIn summary: How can we ensure future technology serves our real needs, rather than mislead us - much like Niko Tinbergen deceived the poor gulls?\n","sig":"819ae4fbfe1b262a8ee267dbb926a0592de900649f072e96f079865edf6b777f23533b24d7d76c4d7ee10b637272d86bd3cc955ac2968bf9e63b72aabcb2e1ad"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xsmnjv35xyensvp5qyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnwdaehgu3wvfskueqzypcvfrjtf2nhsnyjp8nscf8c36utaeyg4rw980atlnlefpcqec7vkqcyqqq823c7m7utq":{"kind":30023,"id":"0dee26a347d2165148fe8fb3f6931865c132008cfcf2745bafb801b502c3405c","pubkey":"70c48e4b4aa7784c9209e70c24f88eb8bee488a8dc53bfabfcff948700ce3ccb","created_at":1745310952,"tags":[["d","1744792413804"],["title","Decentralizing Hope: How Angor Tackles the Real-Life Challenges of Crowdfunding?"],["summary","Crowdfunding changed lives globally, but traditional platforms face issues like inequality, censorship, and fraud.

I found people who believed in my dream of using Bitcoin as money. Every single one of my videos was made possible through crowdfunding. And I’m not alone. I know several Bitcoiners who have raised funds this way, from Africa to Korea to Haiti.\n\nhttps://images.forbesindia.com/media/images/2022/Jul/img_190501_runwithbitcoin_bg.jpg\n\nCrowdfunding is deeply rooted in the traditional financial world. From raising money for life-saving surgeries to helping someone open a local coffee shop, platforms like GoFundMe, Kickstarter, and Indiegogo have become essential tools for many. But behind all the heartwarming stories and viral campaigns, there’s a side of crowdfunding that doesn’t get talked about enough. Traditional platforms are far from perfect.\n\nThey are centralized, which means there’s always someone in control. These platforms can freeze campaigns, delay payouts, or take a significant cut of the money. And often, the people who need funding the most, those without access to strong banking systems or large social media followings are the ones who get left out.\n\nHere are some of the problems I’ve noticed with these platforms:\n\n\n##### **Problem 1: Inequality in Who Gets Funded**\n\n\nA recent article in The Guardian pointed out something that’s hard to ignore. Crowdfunding often benefits people who already have influence. After the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025, celebrities like Mandy Moore were able to raise funds quickly. At the same time, everyday people who lost their homes struggled to get noticed.\n\nhttps://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8398505e58ec3c04685aab06e94048e5d7b6a0c/0_127_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=1300\u0026dpr=1\u0026s=none\u0026crop=none\n\nAngor (https://angor.io/) changes that by removing the need for a central platform to choose which projects get featured or promoted. Anyone can share their project. People can find them on Angor Hub (https://hub.angor.io/), which is a public directory built on the Nostr protocol. Instead of relying on popularity, projects are highlighted based on transparency and engagement.\n\n\n##### **Problem 2: Platform Dependence and Middlemen**\n\n\nHere’s something people don’t often realize. When you raise funds online, the platform usually has control. It holds the money, decides when to release it, and can freeze everything without warning.\nThis happened during the trucker protests in Canada in 2022. Tens of millions of dollars were raised, but platforms like GoFundMe and GiveSendGo froze the donations. The funds never reached the people they were meant for. Supporters were left confused, and the recipients had no way to access what had been raised for them.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Convoi_de_la_libert%C3%A9_%C3%A0_Ottawa_01.jpg/800px-Convoi_de_la_libert%C3%A9_%C3%A0_Ottawa_01.jpg\n\nAngor avoids all of this. It does not hold the funds, does not require approval processes, and only the project creator has control over the campaign. Contributions go directly from supporters to the people building the project, using Bitcoin. It is a peer-to-peer system that works without any gatekeepers.\nAngor never touches the money. It simply provides the tools people need to raise funds and build, while staying fully in control.\n\n\n##### **Problem 3: Global Access**\n\n\nAnother major issue is that these platforms often exclude people based on where they live. If you're in a region with limited banking access or outside the supported list of countries, you’re likely shut out.\nIn 2023, a woman named Samar in Gaza tried to raise funds for food and medical supplies during a crisis. A friend abroad set up a campaign to help, but the platform froze it due to \"location-related concerns.\" The funds were locked, and the support never arrived in time.\n\nhttps://images.gofundme.com/EMFtPWSLs3P9SewkzwZ4FtaBQSA=/720x405/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/78478731_1709065237698709_r.jpeg\n\nAngor removes these barriers by using Bitcoin, which works globally without needing banks or approvals. Anyone, anywhere, can raise and receive support directly.\n\n\n##### **Problem 4: Lack of Transparency**\n\n\nPost-funding transparency is often lacking. Backers rarely get consistent updates, making it difficult to track a project's progress or hold anyone accountable.\n\nIn 2015, the Zano drone project on Kickstarter raised over £2.3 million from more than 12,000 backers. It promised a compact, smart drone for aerial photography. But as time went on, updates became rare and vague. Backers had little insight into the project’s struggles, and eventually, it was canceled. The company shut down, and most backers never received their product or a refund.\n\nhttps://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2A0A/production/_86626701_ff861eeb-ce94-43b7-9a43-b30b5adbd7ab.jpg\n\nAngor takes a different approach. Project updates are shared through Nostr, a decentralized and tamper-proof communication protocol. This allows backers to follow progress in real time, with no corporate filters and no blackout periods. Everyone stays in the loop, from start to finish.\n\n\n##### **Problem 5: Fraud and Accountability**\n\n\nScams are a growing problem in the crowdfunding world. People can launch fake campaigns, collect donations, and vanish — leaving supporters with empty promises and no way to recover their money.\nOne well-known example was the \"Homeless Vet GoFundMe scam\" in the U.S.\n\nhttps://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/720/405/1536549443584.jpg\n\nA couple and a homeless man raised over $400,000 by telling a heartwarming story that later turned out to be completely fake. The money was spent on luxury items, and it took a legal investigation to uncover the truth. By the time it was resolved, most of the funds were gone.\n\nThis kind of fraud is hard to stop on traditional platforms, because once the funds are transferred, there’s no built-in structure to verify how they’re used.\n\nOn Angor, projects are funded in stages, with each step tied to a specific milestone. Bitcoin is held in a shared wallet that only unlocks funds when both the backer and the creator agree that the milestone is complete. If something feels off, backers can choose to stop and recover unspent funds.\n\nThis structure discourages scammers from even trying. It adds friction for bad actors, while still giving honest creators the freedom to build trust, deliver value, and raise support transparently. It can’t get any better than this\n\n*So, does Angor matter?*\n\nFor me, **it really does**. I’m genuinely excited to have my project listed on Angorhub. In a world shaped by AI, open source and transparency light the way forward. Let the work shine on its own.\n\nHave you tried Angor yet?\nThanks for tuning in. \nCatch you next week.

Well, look no further! This post contains a useful list of Nostr based utilities than can enhance your experience in and around the Nostr protocol. \n\n## Search and Discovery\n\nGetting started with Nostr can sometimes feel like a lonely journey, particularly if you're the first of your friends and family to discover how awesome it can be! These tools can help you discover new content, connect with existing follows from other networks and just generally have a poke around at the different types of content Nostr has to offer.\n\n\u003e Have a hobby or existing community elsewhere? Have a search for it here to find others with shared interests\n\n- **[Nostr.Band](https://nostr.band/)** - Search for people, posts, media and stats literally anything Nostr has to offer!\n- **[Nostr.Directory](https://nostr.directory/)** - Find your Twitter follows on Nostr\n- **[Awesome Nostr](https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr#implementations)** - Extensive list of Relay software\n- **[Nostr View](https://nostrview.com/)** - Generic Nostr search\n\n\n![Nostr Band](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/nostrband.png)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n## Relays\n\nRelays might not be the sexiest of topics, particularly for newcomers to the network, but they are a crucial part of what makes Nostr great. As you become more competent, you'll want to customize your relay selection and maybe even run your own! Here are some great starting points.\n\n\u003e Running a personal relay is a powerful way to improve the redundancy of your Nostr events.\n\n- **[Nostr.Watch](https://next.nostr.watch/)** - Browse, test and research Nostr relays\n- **[Nostrwat.ch](https://nostrwat.ch/)** - List of active Nostr relays\n- **[Advanced Nostr Search](https://advancednostrsearch.vercel.app/)** - Targetted search with date ranges\n- **[Nostr.Wine](https://nostr.wine/)** - Reliable paid Relay\n\n![Umbrel Relay](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/umbrelnode.jpeg)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n## NIP-05 Identity Services\n\nYour nPub, or public key (that long string of letters and numbers) is your ‘official’ Nostr ID, but it’s not exactly catchy. NIP-05 identifiers are a human-readable and easily shareable way to have people find you on Nostr. They look like an email address, like qna@hellonostr.xyz. If you have your own domain\nand web server, you can easily [create your own](https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/nostr-account-nip-05-verified/) NIP-05 identifier in just a few minutes. If you don't, you'll want to leverage one of the many free or paid solutions.\n\n\u003e Make yourself easier to find on Nostr with a NIP-05 identifier\n\n- **[Bitcoiner.Chat](https://bitcoiner.chat/)** - Free service operated by [QnA](nostr:npub15c88nc8d44gsp4658dnfu5fahswzzu8gaxm5lkuwjud068swdqfspxssvx)\n- **[Nostr Plebs](https://nostrplebs.com/)** - Paid service with extra features\n- **[Alby](https://getalby.com/)** - Lightning wallet with + NIP-05 solution\n- **[Nostr Address](https://en.nostraddress.com/)** - Paid service with extra features\n- **[Zaps.Lol](https://zaps.lol/)** - Free service\n\n![Zaps LOL](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/zapslol.png)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n## Key Management\n\nYour private key (or nsec) it the key to your Nostr world. It is what allows you to access and interact with your social graph from any client. It doesn't matter if that client is a micro-blogging app like Amethyst, a podcast app like Fountain, or a P2P marketplace like Plebeian  Market, your nsec is paramount to \nthose interactions. Should your nsec be lost, or fall into the wrong hands, whoever then holds a copy can access Nostr and pretend to be you, meaning that you'll need to start again with a new keypair. Not a nice situation to find yourself in, so treat your nsec VERY carefully.\n\n\u003e Your private key IS your Nostr identity. Treat it with extreme care and do not share it.\n\n- **[Alby](https://getalby.com/)** - Browser extension enabling you to sign into web app without sharing the private key \n- **[Nos2x](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x)** - Another browser extension key manager\n- **[Keys.Band](https://keys.band/)** - Another browser extension key manager\n- **[Amber](https://github.com/greenart7c3/amber)** - Android app for safe nsec storage. Can talk to other clients on the same phone to log in and sign events\n- **[Nostr Signing Device](https://github.com/lnbits/nostr-signing-device)** - Dedicated device to store your nsec\n- **[Passport](https://docs.foundation.xyz)** - Hardware wallet for offline and deterministic nsec generation and storage\n\n![Passport](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/passport1.png)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n## Zap Tools\n\nZaps are one of the most fun parts of Nostr. Never before have we been able to send fractions of a penny, instantly to our friends because their meme made us laugh, or their blog post was very insightful. Zaps use Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a faster and cheaper way to move Bitcoin around. To Zap someone, you need a Lightning wallet linked to your Nostr client. Some clients, like Primal, ship with their own custodial wallet to make getting started a breeze. Most clients also allow more advanced users to connect an existing Lightning Wallet to reduce reliance and trust in the client provider.\n\n- **[Alby](https://getalby.com/)** - Browser extension and self-custodial Lightning wallet \n- **[LNBits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits)** - A Zap server running on your own Bitcoin node\n- **[BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/)** - Another Zap server running on your own Bitcoin node\n- **[Zeus](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus)** - Zap compatible self-custodial mobile Lightning wallet\n- **[Nostr Wallet Connect](https://nwc.dev/)** - Communication protocol between Lightning wallets and Nostr apps\n- **[Ecash Wallets](https://github.com/cashubtc/awesome-cashu)** - Custodial Ecash based wallets that are interoperable with Lightning and Nostr (Funds may be at risk)\n- **[Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/)** - Custodial Lightning wallet (Funds may be at risk)\n\n![Zaps](https://hellonostr.xyz/images/zaps1.png)\n\n---\n\nIf you found this post useful, please share it with your peers and consider following and zapping me on Nostr.

Since Nostr is a decentralized protocol and not a platform, there is often a lack of consensus around particular terminologies. At times, it's important to differentiate between them, so that you can determine what is being stated. In the truest sense, there is no central entity to maintain a Nostr 'account' on your behalf, though some Nostr-based platforms may offer to do so. There's also no one to verify your 'identity'. This is something that you create, maintain and control. It is 100% yours. In a sense, you verify yourself through your interactions with others, with the network of clients and relays, and by protecting your nsec (secret key). A profile is generally considered to be a single place for displaying your content and any information about yourself that you've chosen to share, but its a little more complicated than that with Nostr. Let's take a closer look at all 3 terms:\n\n\n### Identity:\n\nYour Nostr identity becomes yours from the moment you generate your key pair. The two parts each provide unique perspective and functionality. (Remember, there is no central entity to issue these key pairs. You can screw up and start over. You can maintain multiple key pairs for different purposes. If all of this is new and unfamiliar, start simply with the intention of trial and error.)\n\nHalf of the equation is your nsec. As long as you maintain control of that secret key, the identity is yours. You will use it to sign the notes and events that you create on Nostr. You will use it to access functionality of various tools and apps. You can use it to send monetary tips for content you find valuable. The reputation that you build through posting \u0026 interacting on Nostr will signal to others what type of person or profile this is, whether it's a genuine person, a bot (good or bad), a collection of works, etc. You might come across information that compares your nsec to a password. While a fair comparison, its important to remember that passwords can be reset, but your private key CANNOT. Lost access or control of your nsec means a loss of control over that identity. When you have decided to establish a more permanent identity, write it down, keep it safe, and use the appropriate security tools for interacting online.\n\nThe other half of this equation is your npub. This public key is used to find and display your notes and events to others. In short, your npub is how your identity is viewed by others and your nsec is how you control that identity.\n\nNpub can also act a window into your world for whoever may choose to view it. As mentioned in a previous entry, npub login enables viewing Nostr's notes and other stuff in a read-only mode of any user's follow feed. Clients may or may not support this, some will even allow you to view and subscribe to these feeds while signed in as yourself via this function. It the basis of the metadata for your profile, too.\n\n\n### Profile:\n\nProfile, in general, is a collection of things about you, which you have chosen to share. This might include your bio, chosen display name, other contact information, and a profile photo. Similar to traditional socials, veiwing Nostr profiles often includes a feed of the things you have posted and shared displayed as a single page. People will recognize you based on the aspects of your profile more than they will by your actual identity since an npub is a prefixed random string of characters . Your npub bridges a gap between strictly machine readable data and your human readable name, but it is not as simple as a name and picture. You will choose your photo and display name for your profile as you see fit, making you recognizable. These aspects are easy for copycat scammers to leverage, so your npub will help your friends and followers to verify that you are you, in the event that someone should try to copy your profile.\n\nThe Nostr protocol has another profile aspect that is important to know about, but as a general user, you shouldn't have to worry much about it. This is your nprofile. It combines your npub (or the machine readable hex verison of it) with hints to what relays you are using to publish your notes. This helps clients, crawlers, and relays find your stuff for your followers. You may notice nprofile when you share a profile link or used in other actions. When you update your relay list, your client will adjust your nprofile and send a new copy to the appropriate relays. If your believe that a client is not doing that correctly, you can visit metadata.nostr.com and manage it yourself.\n\n\n### Account:\n\nAcross Nostr, it is common to see the term 'account' used to refer to the combination of your identity and profile. It is a relatable term, though it may imply that some account issuer exists, but no one issues a Nostr account to you. You create and maintain it yourself.\n\nThere are situations where a traditional account will exist, such as with media servers, relay subscriptions, custodial wallet hosts, or NIP-05 providers. These things will almost always be paid services and storage that you choose to use. (Reminder: all of these things are possible to DIY with a little knowhow and an old computer)\n\n\n### What Is The Right Terminology?\n\nThere is no simple or correct answer here. Developers and writers will use whatever terms fit their scope and topic. Context will matter, so it's important to differentiate by that more than any actual term.","sig":"759512ec04423d6bdbdf55b0dc559772d6ff290000a808340d3a80e79a1bbab917c31b61c1dab07c0c8a0e85168a08b8dc30772a3a56576274f7411138621a00"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xvcnsvfjxs6ryve4qyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnwdaehgu3wvfskueqzyq7r38y0f4rv4qf3vap68ceuakcaqcvlsauwuax5wfjhwhn69mlh7qcyqqq823cxa33td":{"kind":30023,"id":"876d85c830982142d108de4ce9028bfd51b607f5213caaf8da07162785156c74","pubkey":"3c389c8f4d46ca81316743a3e33cedb1d0619f8778ee74d47265775e7a2eff7f","created_at":1743181817,"tags":[["d","1743181244235"],["title","Its Time for a New Social Experience, Maybe Even a Whole New Web."],["summary",""],["t","nostr"],["published_at","1743181817"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzq0pcnj8563k2syckwsaruv7wmvwsvx0cw78wwn28yethteazalmlqqxnzde5xvcnsvfjxs6ryve4s9397y"]],"content":"There is a new web being built on Nostr. At it's core, is a social experience paralleled by no other decentralized protocol. Nostr not only solves the problems of siloed relationships, third-party identity ownership, and algorithmic content control; it makes possible a ubiquitous social network across almost anything imaginable. User controlled identity, open data, and verifiable social graphs allow us to redefine trust on the web. We can interact with each other and online content in ways that have previously only been pipedreams. Nostr is not just social media, it is the web made social.\n\n\n### Interoperability\n\nThe client/relay relationship on Nostr allows for almost endless data exchange between various apps, clients, relays, and users. If any two things are willing to speak the same sub-protocol(s) within Nostr, they can exchange data. Making a friend list enables that list to be used in any other place that chooses to make it available. Creating a relay to serve an algorithmic social feed makes that feed viewable in any client that displays social feeds. Health data held by a patient can be shared with any care provider, verified by their system, and vice versa. This is the point where I have to acknowledge my own tech-deaf limitations and direct you towards nostr.com for more information.\n\n\n### Data Resiliency\n\nI prefer to use the term resiliency here, because its really a mix of data redundancy and self-managed data that creates broad availability. Relays may host 10, 20, 30+ copies of your notes in different locations, but you also have no assurance that those relays will hosts those notes forever. An individual operating their own relay, while also connecting to the wider network, ensures resiliency in events such that wide swaths of the network should disappear or collude against an individual. The simplicity of relay management makes it possible for nearly anyone to make sure that they have a way to convey their messages to their individual network, whether that be close contacts, an audience, or one individual. This resiliency doesn't just apply to typical speech, it applies to any data intended to be shared amongst humans and machines alike.\n\n\n### Pseudonymity and Anonymity\n\nWith privacy encroachment from corporations, advertisers, and governments reaching all time highs, the need for identity protecting tools is also on the rise. Nostr utilizes public key encryption for its identity system. As there is no central entity to \"verify\" you, there is no need to expose any personal identifiable information to any Nostr app, client, or relay. You can protect your personal identity by simply choosing not to expose it. Your reputation will build as you interact with others on the Nostr network. Your social capital can speak for itself. (As with everything else, utilizing a VPN is recommended.)\n\n\n### Identity and Provability\n\nNo one can stop an impersonator from trying to hijack an identity. With Nostr, you CAN prove that you are you, though, which is basically the same as saying \"that person is not me\" Every note you write, every action you take, is cryptographically signed by your private key. As long as you maintain control of that key, you can prove what you did or did not do.\n\n\n### Censorship Resistance\n\nIf you have read our Relay Rundown then you probably get the idea. If not here's the tl;dr: Many small, lightweight relays make up Nostr's distribution system. They are simple enough that anyone can run one. They are redundant enough that you can be almost certain your content exists somewhere. If that is not peace of mind enough, you can run your own with ease. Censorship resistance isn't counting on one company, man, or server to protect what you say. It is taking control of your speech. Nostr makes it easy.\n\n\n### Freedom of Mind and Association\n\nNostr eliminates the need for company run algorithms that high-jack your attention to feed the advertising industry. You are free to choose your social media experience. Nostr's DVMs, curations, and conversation-centered relays offer discovery mechanisms run by any number of providers. That could be an individual, a company, a group, or you. Many clients incorporate different ways of engaging with these corporate algorithm alternatives. You can also choose to keep a purely chronological feed of the the things and people you follow. Exploring Nostr through its many apps opens up a the freedom to choose what and how you feed your mind.\n\nWhen we are able to explore, we end up surrounding ourselves with people who share our interests \u0026 hobbies. We find friends. This creates distance between ideologies and stark beliefs that often are used as the basis for the term \"being in a bubble\". Instead of bubbling off, an infinitely open space of thoughts and ideas allows for groups to gather naturally. In this way, we can choose not to block ourselves off from opposing views but to simply distance ourselves from them.\n\nNostr's relay system also allows for the opposite. Tight-knit communities can create a space for its members to socialize and exchange information with minimal interference from any outside influence. By setting up their own relays with strict rules, the members can utilize one identity to interact within a community or across the broader social network.","sig":"f4f5f9c4f35a81f61235243090f67c1c10c393d2b6110ea62c59868e8d6b6ee4c58d8d27f8928fdb69de9a2734888840016cee7affdca7c1f67be67b889ad042"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xvcrgdpkx56n2vfeqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnwdaehgu3wvfskueqzyz5dz4sddfj865qknyt8y3hjx7eklvfrlzgk3ldprhr5x5ela3aqsqcyqqq823chvk369":{"kind":30023,"id":"fb5249eb242bc5781f0c574148c40ded383f6ba3f1c88813b1d7c68180687343","pubkey":"a8d1560d6a647d501699167246f237b36fb123f89168fda11dc743533fec7a08","created_at":1743045123,"tags":[["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it on https://pareto.space/a/naddr1qqxnzde5xvcrgdpkx56n2vfeqgs2352kp44xgl2sz6v3vujx7gmmxma3y0ufz68a5ywuws6n8lk85zqrqsqqqa28qyv8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnsv9ex2ar09eehqctrv5rr7rvw"],["L","ISO-639-1"],["l","en","ISO-639-1"],["published_at","1743045123"],["d","1743044655519"],["image","https://nostr.download/8450bff5fb7a42c813c6705c1a8e3c1baca70a2effa26596a6f0a8939c31e6b0.png"],["summary","Images, videos, livestreams"],["title","Nostr-Desktop Update"],["t","nostr"],["t","ai"],["zap","a8d1560d6a647d501699167246f237b36fb123f89168fda11dc743533fec7a08","wss://nostr.pareto.space","80"],["zap","0f479c7dff7bb53dae53f3bb32ad1109edbb07ba562bdd5168044b3f4364e7b5","wss://nostr.pareto.space","20"],["client","Pareto","31990:0f479c7dff7bb53dae53f3bb32ad1109edbb07ba562bdd5168044b3f4364e7b5:8020802080208020"]],"content":"I have made a big update to my Nostr desktop.

The thing is Nostr is ideal for this, but first things first:\n\nIt all started when I suddenly woke up to see my twitter bot [@cryptoratingbot](https://x.com/cryptoratingbot) suspended without any explanation. I contacted support, but they apparently considered my case too insignificant to even respond. The goal of my bot was to attract users and provide free tools like [charts.xport.top](https://charts.xport.top/), [tickerbell.xport.top](https://tickerbell.xport.top/) and few others that you can find out about in my previous publications. It worked, and accumulated all in all around 60k engagement a year. Silly, right? You can do this in two days doing it the right way. But I was in no hurry. Overall I gained 10 new users per day and that was enough for me to begin with since I wasn’t prepared for the big wave of users. But that is not the topic for today. I can tell you more about this later on, if you are interested click like and subscribe.\n\nI was planning to buy a premium, but then twitter suspended my bot which actually didn’t do anything bad if you think about it. Furthermore, it was useful, otherwise why would people use it and like its tweets. Anyway, this ruined my plans and forced me to think about switching to Nostr. Today I can tell that it was definitely worth it! I haven’t lost anything, except time and overall gained from it! But I won’t say too much, so as not to bore you. However, this context is important for a better understanding of my situation. There are much more details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask, I will try to answer everyone.\n\nHard to believe, but these things can help you make money from buying cryptocurrency on the bottoms in a right time just when it starts trading, if you understand what you’re doing. That’s not easy. Maybe I will share some thoughts later on, until then you may find more info in my previous articles.\n\nIn fact, I decided to write this because for the first time since I was introduced to Nostr I finally tried proof-of-work([nip-13](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/13.md) pow) myself and I love it! I see such a thing for the first time on a social media. No moderation or censorship measures are needed. After all, if you are ready to burn resources to publish events, then it is definitely not a spam. And that’s the beauty of it!\n\nI’ve picked 7 relays to try and publish 5000+ events that my previous version collected from top 12 cryptocurrency exchanges. Two relays rejected those events after some time, most likely because as always I have forgot to add something crucial — nonce tag, to help relays understand I am using pow. I thought it would add it itself, but seemes that it wouldn’t. What a shame! However, other 5 relays are ok with that! Maybe because I wasn’t publishing events too often, I don’t know, but anyway the more freedom the more I love it! And if you want find more about relays you can use use [nostrwat.ch](https://nostrwat.ch/) which is the greatest resource for finding the best relays to use.\n\nWhile I was writing this article, another few relays dropped connections, but that’s fine, I have selected 7 relays out of about 700 active online.\n\nThis is how my server statistics looks like:\n![cpu operations per second](https://i.imgur.com/VB2JinG.png)\n![packets per second](https://i.imgur.com/oaFh6Ls.png)\n![bytes per second](https://i.imgur.com/gVUTFZg.png)\nSo, besides everything else, I also checked [Netcup root server G11](https://www.netcup.com/en/server/root-server) stats. In my opinion, this is the best of all that I have ever dealt with. And this is not an advertisement, no. I found this company on my own, just watching how Nostr relays works in terms of price/quality, so this is my personal recommendation. But if you think you know better root server solutions please let me know in the comment below.\n\nThe only disadvantage I have encountered is you can wait for their support for few days to answer, but that’s ok if you know what you’re doing. I have no problem with this. I try to be careful and there were no problems for two months since I ordered it and use it on the daily basis.\n\nIn short, this is my journey. Don’t scold me for this. It’s just that I’ve been saving all this up for a long time, and today I realized that I simply have to tell you about it!\n\nThank you all and see you soon!

[More technically](https://nips.nostr.com/5), it the part of the protocol that defines how to do this mapping, but you will often see the resulting identifier referred to as \"your NIP-05\". You will also see it referenced as a \"Nostr Address\", a \"Nostr ID\", or a \"Nostr Verification\". None of those terms are fully correct but nor are they wrong.\n\nA NIP-05 identifier does look very similar to an email address (i.e. NostrName @ SomeSite .com). It makes it easier to convey your Nostr profile to friends or collogues, since your chosen name is not unique and the npub format is not exactly something you will be wanting to jot down at a business meeting. It can be used to find you and your notes, so the term, Nostr Address, fits in that sense. There are free services that provide a NIP-05 to you, but you may want to consider contracting this service to a paid provider. Free services tend to be abused by spammers. Paid NIP-05 providers are reasonably priced, more reputable, provide select affiliations, and often other services, along with hosting your Nip-05 file.\n\nNostr ID might be the appropriate term, in a different way. Your NIP-05 is unique. You are not limited to possessing a single one, but only one may be present on your profile at any given time. You can switch them out as needed. Some Nostr-based services will require that you have a particular NIP-05 provider in order to access their relay communities or other features. In that sense, it is an ID, proving that you are a member of that community. These NIP-05 IDs are created and hosted for you by the community relay hosts, with whatever criteria they choose to require.\n\nNostr Verification comes into consideration if you own or run a website. It can be used to validate your identity. By hosting your NIP-05 file on your own domain, you are, in essence, validating that the same person has ownership of the website and control of the associated Nostr profile. (i.e. YourName @ YourSite .com) This is exceptionally handy for any well known individual who may be subject to impersonation. This is great, too, if you sell a product or service online and would like to use Nostr as a means of advertising and engaging with your customers. Your NIP-05 can signal to your customers that you, or any employee, are affiliated with your company.\n\nAll of this, for me to tell you... that you don't need a NIP-05 identifier to use Nostr. It just makes a lot of the things you might want to do simpler.

Draghi's verdict was harsh: Europe is facing an \"existential challenge.\" It's hard to disagree. While the EU is launching new regulations on plastic corks and [hiding text messages from the public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizergate), Elon Musk is changing the world with groundbreaking innovations in the automotive, robotics, and space industries.\n\n**At the same time that the EU is not only preventing people from trying new things but also preventing them from even thinking about trying, Musk's space company SpaceX is capturing massive star rockets with \"chopstick grips\".** While the EU is stuck in an ocean of meaningless bureaucratic details, Musk is engaged in a process of constant testing and improvement, reminiscent of the natural course of decentralized systems.\n\nThe EU's meager economic growth can be compared to a ticking time bomb that threatens to explode in all of our faces. Disposable incomes have increased nearly twice as much in the US compared to the EU since 2000, and this is a difference that is noticeable not only in our standard of living but also in our opportunities for leisure time. As the late economist Robert Lucas said, \"Once you start thinking about growth, it's hard to think about anything else.\" **Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the report is that its abundance of words, numbers, and images underscores how bad things are.** And perhaps it has therefore become impossible for the EU's leaders to continue ignoring the union's problems.\n\n#### Like giving a shark responsibility for beach safety\n\nHowever, asking a former EU president to investigate and propose changes is like giving a shark responsibility for beach safety. Among other things, he proposes larger allocations for research and development, even though the EU already spends more than the US as a percentage of GDP - it's thus impossible for this to be the problem. **It comes as no surprise that the proposals are about more centralization, harmonization, and streamlining - i.e., continuing in the same old tracks**. While Musk seems to have an intuitive understanding of how knowledge arises through [real-world experiments](https://www.affarsvarlden.se/kronika/enlund-globalismen-ar-den-riktiga-pandemin-ge-oss-mer-av-naringslivets-superkraft) , what is proposed here is more of the administrative bureaucracy's preconceived five-year plans. The bureaucracy is to be given free rein, and the nations are to be pushed back - a repeat of a theme we know all too well. **Centralization undermines real knowledge growth, which may explain why the EU is falling behind.**\n\n#### A venomous snake that is ignored\n\n**Rent-seeking is like a venomous snake that slithers through the EU's corridors, but the concept is conspicuous by its absence in Draghi's report**. It is a well-known phenomenon where companies spend resources on influencing decision-makers to gain advantages instead of creating value. The EU bureaucracy has produced a total of 13,000 legislative acts since 2019 - more than four times as many as the US. How many of these have received an invisible stamp of approval from lobbyists? Economist Jeffrey Sachs has [warned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls1j16bN8S0) that American lobbying in Brussels is so dominant that it affects all decision-making in the digital economy, which may be one of the EU's biggest problems. GDPR regulations, for example, are estimated to have reduced small tech companies' profits by [15%](https://x.com/sytaylor/status/1833460011491537138) (!).\n\n#### Size is not everything\n\n**Small businesses are the invisible heroes that contribute most to productivity and employment growth. These are being suffocated by the ECB's actions** and the constantly increasing and inefficient [regulatory mess](https://www.affarsvarlden.se/kronika/martin-enlund-regel-cirkusen-kostar-mycket-mer-an-den-smakar). The ECB's war on small banks hampers growth for small businesses because large banks prioritize large transactions. Big computers' algorithms cannot replace small banks' local knowledge. Harmful regulations and grandiose dreams lead to a loss of both knowledge and growth.\n\n#### What should the end goal be?\n\nSweden's daily Dagens Industri's editorial page recently wrote that \"Defeat is not an option\" on the theme of green transition. It asked whether \"free democracies or a Chinese dictatorship should lead the way.\" Large-scale industrial projects and plans can undoubtedly provide benefits. **But it's worth questioning whether Europe should really have the same end goal as China.**\n\nDuring both the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution, decentralized power structures played a crucial role. During the Renaissance, states and cities were relatively independent. Power was decentralized to princes, nobles, and merchants. The Church had an important role, but it was not as centralized as it would become. Florence, Venice, and Amsterdam could develop different scientific and artistic traditions. **When one region encountered problems, other regions could continue to develop and grow, and so on.** At that time - even if the concept did not exist - it seemed to be understood that the economy is a complex system of the second order. Or a computationally irreducible one, as Stephen Wolfram would have expressed it.\n\nIn the book \"The Art of War,\" Chinese General Sun Tzu wrote that \"He who chooses the battlefield first will win. He who lets his opponent choose the battlefield will lose.\" Instead of striving to play on China's (alleged) centralized battlefield, perhaps we Europeans should consider returning to our roots. Do away with the bureaucracy's heavy foot and give power back to the individual! Scrap the monster banks and create conditions for small local banks instead. Stop subsidizing American IT giants' data centers and give every European an AI in their own hand. **Forget the five-year plans and invest in decentralized economic experiments instead.** Does that sound radical?\n\nThe word \"radical\" comes from the Latin word for root, *radix* . The word used to have a positive connotation because it implied a willingness to go to the root of the problem or to return to one's roots.\n\nMore of us should dare to question the modern structures that brought us to today's sad situation. Roots are a plant's strength - without them, it cannot grow and flourish. So it is with Europe. **Our continent, which was once a thriving garden where ideas and innovations bloomed, needs to return to its roots to regain its former strength.** This may be exactly what is required.\n\nPut simply: a more radical Europe.\n","sig":"76e9efd5a0cb18852a32b04b69a569b09fd72c407aab9ba29aace0c11de724bd7fd3013956929552fdeede045823d97bd69f361260361ff841b46d55e8fcc92d"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xy6rqvpjx5en2dpsqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyq53cawex7j97e4pyz0cafnprhm5frzekdfx2gxxdj3vmnfh7xlmuqcyqqq823ch20gmy":{"kind":30023,"id":"ba77c949182a3dc86942c6e2c0540f2fabd331013301cf2ff6b9a1a6ab35c3d1","pubkey":"291c75d937a45f66a1209f8ea6611df7448c59b3526520c66ca2cdcd37f1bfbe","created_at":1741406999,"tags":[["d","1741400253540"],["title","Junto in the Tavern, Notes on the Web"],["summary","Comparing Ben Franklin's Junto to a future built on Nostr shows how the tools of community and debate evolve with time.

What began as a small gathering of tradesmen and thinkers would leave a lasting mark on Franklin’s life and colonial America.\n\n\u003e Printers are educated in the belief that when men differ in opinion, both sides ought equally to have the advantage of being heard by the public, and that when Truth and Error have fair play, the former is always an overmatch for the latter. \u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e - Benjamin Franklin\n\n**The Junto** operated under a clear set of rules, detailed by Franklin in his Autobiography:\n\n\"The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss’d by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and, to prevent warmth [heatedness], all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties [monetary fines].\"\n\nThese guidelines emphasized collaboration over competition. Members were expected to contribute questions or essays, sparking discussions that prioritized truth over ego. To keep debates civil, the group even imposed small fines for overly assertive or contradictory behavior—a practical nudge toward humility and open-mindedness. (Yes, I believe that is an ass tax!)\n\nRather than admitting new members, Franklin encouraged existing ones to form their own discussion groups. This created a decentralized network of groups (\"private relays,\" as I think of them), echoing the structure of modern platforms like NOSTR—while preserving the Junto’s exclusivity and privacy.\n\nFrom the beginning, they made it a rule to keep these meetings secret, without applications or admittance of new members. Instead, Franklin encouraged members to form their own groups—in a way acting as private relays of sorts. (I say \"private\" because they continued to keep the Junto secret, even with these new groups.)\n\n## Membership: A Diverse Circle United by Values\nThe Junto’s twelve founding members came from varied walks of life—printers, surveyors, shoemakers, and clerks—yet shared a commitment to self-improvement. Franklin, though the youngest (around 21 when the group formed), led the Junto with a vision of collective growth. To join, candidates faced a simple vetting process, answering four key questions:\n\n1. Have you any particular disrespect for any present members? Answer: I have not.\n2. Do you sincerely declare that you love mankind in general, of what profession or religion soever? Answer: I do.\n3. Do you think any person ought to be harmed in his body, name, or goods, for mere speculative opinions, or his external way of worship? Answer: No.\n4. Do you love truth for truth’s sake, and will you endeavor impartially to find and receive it yourself and communicate it to others? Answer: Yes.\n\nThese criteria reveal the Junto’s core values: respect, tolerance, and an unwavering pursuit of truth. They ensured that members brought not just intellect but also character to the table—placing dialogue as the priority.\n\nOne should also note the inspiration from the \"Dry Club\" of John Locke, William Popple, and Benjamin Furly in the 1690s. They too required affirmation to:\n\n1. Whether he loves all men, of what profession or religion soever?\n2. Whether he thinks no person ought to be harmed in his body, name, or goods, for mere speculative opinions, or his external way of worship?\n3. Whether he loves and seeks truth for truth’s sake; and will endeavor impartially to find and receive it himself, and to communicate it to others?\n\nAnd they agreed: *\"That no person or opinion be unhandsomely reflected on; but every member behave himself with all the temper, judgment, modesty, and discretion he is master of.\"*\n\n## The Discussions: 24 Questions to Spark Insight\nFranklin crafted a list of 24 questions to guide the Junto’s conversations, ranging from personal anecdotes to civic concerns. These prompts showcase the group’s intellectual breadth. Here are some of my favorites:\n\n\n\u003e Hath any citizen in your knowledge failed in his business lately, and what have you heard of the cause?\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\nHave you lately heard of any citizen’s thriving well, and by what means?\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\nDo you know of any fellow citizen who has lately done a worthy action, deserving praise and imitation?\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\nDo you think of anything at present in which the Junto may be serviceable to mankind, their country, friends, or themselves?\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\nHave you lately observed any defect in the laws of your country, which it would be proper to move the legislature for an amendment?\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\nDo you know of any deserving young beginner lately set up, whom it lies in the power of the Junto any way to encourage?\u003c/br\u003e\n\n(Read them all [here](https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/becomingamer/ideas/text4/juntolibrary.pdf).)\n\nNote the keen attention to success and failure, and the reflection on both. Attention was often placed on the community and individual improvement beyond the members of the group. These questions encouraged members to share knowledge, reflect on virtues and vices, and propose solutions to real-world problems. The result? Discussions that didn’t just end at the tavern door but inspired tangible community improvements.\n\n## The Junto’s Legacy: America’s First Lending Library\nOne of the Junto’s most enduring contributions to Philadelphia—and indeed, to the American colonies—was the creation of the first lending library in 1731. Born from the group’s commitment to mutual improvement and knowledge-sharing, this library became a cornerstone of public education and intellectual life in the community.\n\nThe idea for the library emerged naturally from the Junto’s discussions. Members, who came from diverse backgrounds but shared a passion for learning, recognized that their own access to books was often limited and costly—and they referred to them often. To address this, they proposed pooling their personal collections to create a shared resource. This collaborative effort allowed them—and eventually the broader public—to access a wider range of books than any individual could afford alone.\n\nThe library operated on a simple yet revolutionary principle: knowledge should be available to all, regardless of wealth or status. By creating a lending system, the Junto democratized access to information, fostering a culture of self-education and curiosity. This was especially significant at a time when books were scarce and formal education was not universally accessible.\n\nThe success of the Junto’s library inspired similar initiatives across the colonies, laying the groundwork for the public library system we know today. It also reflected the group’s broader mission: to serve not just its members but the entire community. The library became a symbol of the Junto’s belief in the power of education to uplift individuals and society alike.\n\n\u003e With roots extending back to the founding of the Society in 1743, the Library of the American Philosophical Society houses over thirteen million manuscripts, 350,000 volumes and bound periodicals, 250,000 images, and thousands of hours of audiotape. The Library’s holdings make it one of the premier institutions for documenting the history of the American Revolution and Founding, the study of natural history in the 18th and 19th centuries, the study of evolution and genetics, quantum mechanics, and the development of cultural anthropology, among others.\n\nThe [American Philosophical Society Library](https://www.amphilsoc.org/library) continues today. I hope to visit it myself in the future.\n\n## Freedom, for Community\nComparing the Junto to Nostr shows how the tools of community and debate evolve with time. Both prove that people crave spaces to connect, share, and grow—whether in a colonial tavern or a digital relay. Yet their differences reveal trade-offs: the Junto’s structure offered depth and focus but capped its reach, while Nostr’s openness promises scale at the cost of order.\n\nIn a sense, Nostr feels like the Junto’s modern echo—faster, bigger, and unbound by gates or rules. Franklin might admire its ambition, even if he’d raise an eyebrow at its messiness. For us, the comparison underscores a timeless truth: no matter the medium, the drive to seek truth and build community endures.\n\n---\n\nThe Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (1771–1790, pub. 1791)\n\nhttp://www.benjamin-franklin-history.org/junto-club/\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces, ed.

Some wide-eyed fanatic has convinced you that the \"sun shines every day on the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees\" in a magical land of decentralized, censorship-resistant freedom of speech - and it's waiting just over the next hill.\n\nBut your experience has not been all you hoped. Before you've even had a chance to upload your AI-generated cyberpunk avatar or make up exploit codenames for your pseudonym's bio, you've been confronted with a new concept that has left you completely nonplussed.\n\nIt doesn't help that this new idea might be called by any number of strange names. You may have been asked to \"paste your nsec\", \"generate a private key\", \"enter your seed words\", \"connect with a bunker\", \"sign in with extension\", or even \"generate entropy\". Sorry about that.\n\nAll these terms are really referring to one concept under many different names: that of \"cryptographic identity\".\n\nNow, you may have noticed that I just introduced yet another new term which explains exactly nothing. You're absolutely correct. And now I'm going to proceed to ignore your complaints and talk about something completely different. But bear with me, because the juice is worth the squeeze.\n\n# Identity\n\nWhat is identity? There are many philosophical, political, or technical answers to this question, but for our purposes it's probably best to think of it this way:\n\n\u003e Identity is the essence of a thing. Identity separates one thing from all others, and is itself indivisible.\n\nThis definition has three parts:\n\n- Identity is \"essential\": a thing can change, but its identity cannot. I might re-paint my house, replace its components, sell it, or even burn it down, but its identity as something that can be referred to - \"this house\" - is durable, even outside the boundaries of its own physical existence.\n- Identity is a unit: you can't break an identity into multiple parts. A thing might be _composed_ of multiple parts, but that's only incidental to the identity of a thing, which is a _concept_, not a material thing.\n- Identity is distinct: identity is what separates one thing from all others - the concept of an apple can't be mixed with that of an orange; the two ideas are distinct. In the same way, a single concrete apple is distinct in identity from another - even if the component parts of the apple decompose into compost used to grow more apples.\n\nIdentity is not a physical thing, but a metaphysical thing. Or, in simpler terms, identity is a \"concept\".\n\nI (or someone more qualified) could at this point launch into a Scholastic tangent on what \"is\" is, but that is, fortunately, not necessary here. The kind of identities I want to focus on here are not our _actual_ identities as people, but entirely _fictional_ identities that we use to extend our agency into the digital world.\n\nThink of it this way - your bank login does not represent _you_ as a complete person. It only represents the _access granted to you_ by the bank. This access is in fact an _entirely new identity_ that has been associated with you, and is limited in what it's useful for.\n\nOther examples of fictional identities include:\n\n- The country you live in\n- Your social media persona\n- Your mortgage\n- Geographical coordinates\n- A moment in time\n- A chess piece\n\nSome of these identites are inert, for example points in space and time. Other identies have agency and so are able to act in the world - even as fictional concepts. In order to do this, they must \"authenticate\" themselves (which means \"to prove they are real\"), and act within a system of established rules.\n\nFor example, your D\u0026D character exists only within the collective fiction of your D\u0026D group, and can do anything the rules say. Its identity is authenticated simply by your claim as a member of the group that your character in fact exists. Similarly, a lawyer must prove they are a member of the Bar Association before they are allowed to practice law within that collective fiction.\n\n\"Cryptographic identity\" is simply another way of authenticating a fictional identity within a given system. As we'll see, it has some interesting attributes that set it apart from things like a library card or your latitude and longitude. Before we get there though, let's look in more detail at how identities are authenticated.\n\n# Certificates\n\nMerriam-Webster defines the verb \"certify\" as meaning \"to attest authoritatively\". A \"certificate\" is just a fancy way of saying \"because I said so\". Certificates are issued by a \"certificate authority\", someone who has the authority to \"say so\". Examples include your boss, your mom, or the Pope.\n\nThis method of authentication is how almost every institution authenticates the people who associate with it. Colleges issue student ID cards, governments issue passports, and websites allow you to \"register an account\".\n\nIn every case mentioned above, the \"authority\" creates a closed system in which a document (aka a \"certificate\") is issued which serves as a claim to a given identity. When someone wants to access some privileged service, location, or information, they present their certificate. The authority then validates it and grants or denies access. In the case of an international airport, the certificate is a little book printed with fancy inks. In the case of a login page, the certificate is a username and password combination.\n\nThis pattern for authentication is ubiquitous, and has some very important implications.\n\nFirst of all, certified authentication implies that the issuer of the certificate has the right to _exclusive control_ of any identity it issues. This identity can be revoked at any time, or its permissions may change. Your social credit score may drop arbitrarily, or money might disappear from your account. When dealing with certificate authorities, you have no inherent rights.\n\nSecond, certified authentication depends on the certificate authority continuing to exist. If you store your stuff at a storage facility but the company running it goes out of business, your stuff might disappear along with it.\n\nUsually, authentication via certificate authority works pretty well, since an appeal can always be made to a higher authority (nature, God, the government, etc). Authorities also can't generally dictate their terms with impunity without losing their customers, alienating their constituents, or provoking revolt. But it's also true that certification by authority creates an incentive structure that frequently leads to abuse - arbitrary deplatforming is increasingly common, and the bigger the certificate authority, the less recourse the certificate holder (or \"subject\") has.\n\nCertificates also put the issuer in a position to intermediate relationships that wouldn't otherwise be subject to their authority. This might take the form of selling user attention to advertisers, taking a cut of financial transactions, or selling surveillance data to third parties.\n\nProliferation of certificate authorities is not a solution to these problems. Websites and apps frequently often offer multiple \"social sign-in\" options, allowing their users to choose which certificate authority to appeal to. But this only piles more value into the social platform that issues the certificate - not only can Google shut down your email inbox, they can revoke your ability to log in to every website you used their identity provider to get into.\n\nIn every case, certificate issuance results in an asymmetrical power dynamic, where the issuer is able to exert significant control over the certificate holder, even in areas unrelated to the original pretext for the relationship between parties.\n\n# Self-Certification\n\nBut what if we could reverse this power dynamic? What if individuals could issue their own certificates and force institutions to accept them?\n\n![I can do what I want](https://i.gifer.com/6rj.gif)\n\nRon Swanson's counterexample notwithstanding, there's a reason I can't simply write myself a parking permit and slip it under the windshield wiper. Questions about voluntary submission to legitimate authorities aside, the fact is that we don't have the power to act without impunity - just like any other certificate authority, we have to prove our claims either by the exercise of raw power or by appeal to a higher authority.\n\nSo the question becomes: which higher authority can we appeal to in order to issue our own certificates within a given system of identity?\n\nThe obvious answer here is to go straight to the top and ask God himself to back our claim to self-sovereignty. However, that's not how he normally works - there's a reason they call direct acts of God \"miracles\". In fact, Romans 13:1 explicitly says that \"the authorities that exist have been appointed by God\". God has structured the universe in such a way that we must appeal to the deputies he has put in place to govern various parts of the world.\n\nAnother tempting appeal might be to nature - i.e. the material world. This is the realm in which we most frequently have the experience of \"self-authenticating\" identities. For example, a gold coin can be authenticated by biting it or by burning it with acid. If it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\n\nIn most cases however, the ability to authenticate using physical claims depends on physical access, and so appeals to physical reality have major limitations when it comes to the digital world. Captchas, selfies and other similar tricks are often used to bridge the physical world into the digital, but these are increasingly easy to forge, and hard to verify.\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule - an example of self-certification that makes its appeal to the physical world is that of a signature. Signatures are hard to forge - an incredible amount of data is encoded in physical signatures, from strength, to illnesses, to upbringing, to [personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphology). These can even be scanned and used within the digital world as well. Even today, most contracts are sealed with some simulacrum of a physical signature. Of course, this custom is quickly becoming a mere historical curiosity, since the very act of digitizing a signature makes it trivially forgeable.\n\nSo: transcendent reality is too remote to subtantiate our claims, and the material world is too limited to work within the world of information. There is another aspect of reality remaining that we might appeal to: information itself.\n\nPhysical signatures authenticate physical identities by encoding unique physical data into an easily recognizable artifact. To transpose this idea to the realm of information, a \"digital signature\" might authenticate \"digital identities\" by encoding unique \"digital data\" into an easily recognizable artifact.\n\nUnfortunately, in the digital world we have the additional challenge that the artifact itself can be copied, undermining any claim to legitimacy. We need something that can be easily verified _and unforgeable_.\n\n# Digital Signatures\n\nIn fact such a thing does exist, but calling it a \"digital signature\" obscures more than it reveals. We might just as well call the thing we're looking for a \"digital fingerprint\", or a \"digital electroencephalogram\". Just keep that in mind as we work our way towards defining the term - we are not looking for something _looks like a physical signature_, but for something that _does the same thing as_ a physical signature, in that it allows us to issue ourselves a credential that must be accepted by others by encoding privileged information into a recognizable, unforgeable artifact.\n\nWith that, let's get into the weeds.\n\nAn important idea in computer science is that of a \"function\". A function is a sort of information machine that converts data from one form to another. One example is the idea of \"incrementing\" a number. If you increment 1, you get 2. If you increment 2, you get 3. Incrementing can be reversed, by creating a complementary function that instead subtracts 1 from a number.\n\nA \"one-way function\" is a function that can't be reversed. A good example of a one-way function is integer rounding. If you round a number and get `5`, what number did you begin with? It's impossible to know - 5.1, 4.81, 5.332794, in fact an infinite number of numbers can be rounded to the number `5`. These numbers can also be infinitely long - for example rounding PI to the nearest integer results in the number `3`.\n\nA real-life example of a useful one-way function is `sha256`. This function is a member of a family of one-way functions called \"hash functions\". You can feed as much data as you like into `sha256`, and you will always get 256 bits of information out. Hash functions are especially useful because collisions between outputs are very rare - even if you change a single bit in a huge pile of data, you're almost certainly going to get a different output.\n\nTaking this a step further, there is a whole family of cryptographic one-way \"trapdoor\" functions that act similarly to hash functions, but which maintain a specific mathematical relationship between the input and the output which allows the input/output pair to be used in a variety of useful applications. For example, in Elliptic Curve Cryptography, scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve is used to derive the output.\n\n\"Ok\", you say, \"that's all completely clear and lucidly explained\" (thank you). \"But what goes _into_ the function?\" You might expect that because of our analogy to physical signatures we would have to gather an incredible amount of digital information to cram into our cryptographic trapdoor function, mashing together bank statements, a record of our heartbeat, brain waves and cellular respiration. Well, we _could_ do it that way (maybe), but there's actually a _much_ simpler solution.\n\nLet's play a quick game. What number am I thinking of? Wrong, it's 82,749,283,929,834. Good guess though.\n\nThe reason we use signatures to authenticate our identity in the physical world is not because they're backed by a lot of implicit physical information, but because they're hard to forge and easy to validate. Even so, there is a lot of variation in a single person's signature, even from one moment to the next.\n\nTrapdoor functions solve the validation problem - it's trivially simple to compare one 256-bit number to another. And randomness solves the problem of forgeability.\n\nNow, randomness (A.K.A. \"entropy\") is actually kind of hard to generate. Random numbers that don't have enough \"noise\" in them are known as \"pseudo-random numbers\", and are weirdly easy to guess. This is why Cloudflare uses a video stream of their [giant wall of lava lamps](https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/) to feed the random number generator that powers their CDN. For our purposes though, we can just imagine that our random numbers come from rolling a bunch of dice.\n\nTo recap, we can get a digital equivalent of a physical signature (or fingerprint, etc) by 1. coming up with a random number, and 2. feeding it into our chosen trapdoor function. The random number is called the \"private\" part. The output of the trapdoor function is called the \"public\" part. These two halves are often called \"keys\", hence the terms \"public key\" and \"private key\".\n\nAnd now we come full circle - remember about 37 years ago when I introduced the term \"cryptographic identity\"? Well, we've finally arrived at the point where I explain what that actually is.\n\nA \"cryptographic identity\" is _identified_ by a public key, and _authenticated_ by the ability to prove that you know the private key.\n\nNotice that I didn't say \"authenticated by the private key\". If you had to reveal the private key in order to prove you know it, you could only authenticate a public key once without losing exclusive control of the key. But cryptographic identities can be authenticated any number of times because the certification is an _algorithm_ that only someone who knows the private key can execute.\n\nThis is the super power that trapdoor functions have that hash functions don't. Within certain cryptosystems, it is possible to mix additional data with your private key to get yet another number in such a way that someone else who only knows the public key can _prove_ that you know the private key.\n\nFor example, if my secret number is `12`, and someone tells me the number `37`, I can \"combine\" the two by adding them together and returning the number `49`. This \"proves\" that my secret number is `12`. Of course, addition is not a trapdoor function, so it's trivially easy to reverse, which is why cryptography is its own field of knowledge.\n\n# What's it for?\n\nIf I haven't completely lost you yet, you might be wondering why this matters. Who cares if I can prove that I made up a random number?\n\nTo answer this, let's consider a simple example: that of public social media posts.\n\nMost social media platforms function by issuing credentials and verifying them based on their internal database. When you log in to your Twitter (ok, fine, X) account, you provide X with a phone number (or email) and password. X compares these records to the ones stored in the database when you created your account, and if they match they let you \"log in\" by issuing yet another credential, called a \"session key\".\n\nNext, when you \"say\" something on X, you pass along your session key and your tweet to X's servers. They check that the session key is legit, and if it is they associate your tweet with your account's identity. Later, when someone wants to see the tweet, X vouches for the fact that you created it by saying \"trust me\" and displaying your name next to the tweet.\n\nIn other words, X creates and controls your identity, but they let you use it as long as you can prove that you know the secret that you agreed on when you registered (by giving it to them every time).\n\nNow pretend that X gets bought by someone _even more evil_ than Elon Musk (if such a thing can be imagined). The new owner now has the ability to control _your_ identity, potentially making it say things that you didn't actually say. Someone could be completely banned from the platform, but their account could be made to continue saying whatever the owner of the platform wanted.\n\nIn reality, such a breach of trust would quickly result in a complete loss of credibility for the platform, which is why this kind of thing doesn't happen (at least, not that we know of).\n\nBut there are other ways of exploiting this system, most notably by censoring speech. As often happens, platforms are able to confiscate user identities, leaving the tenant no recourse except to appeal to the platform itself (or the government, but that doesn't seem to happen for some reason - probably due to some legalese in social platforms' terms of use). The user has to start completely from scratch, either on the same platform or another.\n\nNow suppose that when you signed up for X instead of simply telling X your password you made up a random number and provided a cryptographic proof to X along with your public key. When you're ready to tweet (there's no need to issue a session key, or even to store your public key in their database) you would again prove your ownership of that key with a new piece of data. X could then publish that tweet or not, along with the same proof you provided that it really came from you.\n\nWhat X _can't_ do in this system is pretend you said something you didn't, because they _don't know your private key_.\n\nX also wouldn't be able to deplatform you as effectively either. While they could choose to ban you from their website and refuse to serve your tweets, they don't control your identity. There's nothing they can do to prevent you from re-using it on another platform. Plus, if the system was set up in such a way that other users followed your key instead of an ID made up by X, you could switch platforms and _keep your followers_. In the same way, it would also be possible to keep a copy of all your tweets in your own database, since their authenticity is determined by _your_ digital signature, not X's \"because I say so\".\n\nThis new power is not just limited to social media either. Here are some other examples of ways that self-issued cryptographic identites transform the power dynamic inherent in digital platforms:\n\n- Banks sometimes freeze accounts or confiscate funds. If your money was stored in a system based on self-issued cryptographic keys rather than custodians, banks would not be able to keep you from accessing or moving your funds. This system exists, and it's called [bitcoin](https://bitcoin.rocks/).\n- Identity theft happens when your identifying information is stolen and used to take out a loan in your name, and without your consent. The reason this is so common is because your credentials are not cryptographic - your name, address, and social security number can only be authenticated by being shared, and they are shared so often and with so many counterparties that they frequently end up in data breaches. If credit checks were authenticated by self-issued cryptographic keys, identity theft would cease to exist (unless your private key itself got stolen).\n- Cryptographic keys allow credential issuers to protect their subjects' privacy better too. Instead of showing your ID (including your home address, birth date, height, weight, etc), the DMV could sign a message asserting that the holder of a given public key indeed over 21. The liquor store could then validate that claim, and your ownership of the named key, without knowing anything more about you. [Zero-knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof) proofs take this a step further.\n\nIn each of these cases, the interests of the property owner, loan seeker, or customer are elevated over the interests of those who might seek to control their assets, exploit their hard work, or surveil their activity. Just as with personal privacy, freedom of speech, and Second Amendment rights the individual case is rarely decisive, but in the aggregate realigned incentives can tip the scale in favor of freedom.\n\n# Objections\n\nNow, there are some drawbacks to digital signatures. Systems that rely on digital signatures are frequently less forgiving of errors than their custodial counterparts, and many of their strengths have corresponding weaknesses. Part of this is because people haven't yet developed an intuition for how to use cryptographic identities, and the tools for managing them are still being designed. Other aspects can be mitigated through judicious use of keys fit to the problems they are being used to solve.\n\nBelow I'll articulate some of these concerns, and explore ways in which they might be mitigated over time.\n\n## Key Storage\n\nKeeping secrets is hard. \"A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on\", and the same goes for gossip. Key storage has become increasingly important as more of our lives move online, to the extent that password managers have become almost a requirement for keeping track of our digital lives. But even with good password management, credentials frequently end up for sale on the dark web as a consequence of poorly secured infrastructure.\n\nApart from the fact that all of this is an argument _for_ cryptographic identities (since keys are shared with far fewer parties), it's also true that the danger of losing a cryptographic key is severe, especially if that key is used in multiple places. Instead of hackers stealing your Facebook password, they might end up with access to all your other social media accounts too!\n\nKeys should be treated with the utmost care. Using password managers is a good start, but very valuable keys should be stored even more securely - for example in a [hardware signing device](https://nostrsigningdevice.com/). This is a hassle, and something additional to learn, but is an indispensable part of taking advantage of the benefits associated with cryptographic identity.\n\nThere are ways to lessen the impact of lost or stolen secrets, however. Lots of different techniques exist for structuring key systems in such a way that keys can be protected, invalidated, or limited. Here are a few:\n\n- [Hierarchical Deterministic Keys](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dijkhuis-cfrg-hdkeys-02.html) allow for the creation of a single root key from which multiple child keys can be generated. These keys are hard to link to the parent, which provides additional privacy, but this link can also be proven when necessary. One limitation is that the identity system has to be designed with HD keys in mind.\n- [Key Rotation](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41796/whats-the-purpose-of-key-rotation) allows keys to become expendable. Additional credentials might be attached to a key, allowing the holder to prove they have the right to rotate the key. Social attestations can help with the process as well if the key is embedded in a web of trust.\n- Remote Signing is a technique for storing a key on one device, but using it on another. This might take the form of signing using a hardware wallet and transferring an SD card to your computer for broadcasting, or using a mobile app like [Amber](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Amber) to manage sessions with different applications.\n- [Key](https://github.com/coracle-social/promenade/tree/master) [sharding](https://www.frostr.org/) takes this to another level by breaking a single key into multiple pieces and storing them separately. A coordinator can then be used to collaboratively sign messages without sharing key material. This dramatically reduces the ability of an attacker to steal a complete key.\n\n## Multi-Factor Authentication\n\nOne method for helping users secure their accounts that is becoming increasingly common is \"multi-factor authentication\". Instead of just providing your email and password, platforms send a one-time use code to your phone number or email, or use \"time-based one time passwords\" which are stored in a password manager or on a hardware device.\n\nAgain, MFA is a solution to a problem inherent in account-based authentication which would not be nearly so prevalent in a cryptographic identity system. Still, theft of keys does happen, and so MFA would be an important improvement - if not for an extra layer of authentication, then as a basis for key rotation.\n\nIn a sense, MFA is already being researched - key shards is one way of creating multiple credentials from a single key. However, this doesn't address the issue of key rotation, especially when an identity is tied to the public key that corresponds to a given private key. There are two possible solutions to this problem:\n\n- Introduce a naming system. This would allow identities to use a durable name, assigning it to different keys over time. The downside is that this would require the introduction of either centralized naming authorities (back to the old model), or a blockchain in order to solve [Zooko's trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle).\n- Establish a chain of keys. This would require a given key to name a successor key in advance and self-invalidate, or some other process like social recovery to invalidate an old key and assign the identity to a new one. This also would significantly increase the complexity of validating messages and associating them with a given identity.\n\nBoth solutions are workable, but introduce a lot of complexity that could cause more trouble than it's worth, depending on the identity system we're talking about.\n\n## Surveillance\n\nOne of the nice qualities that systems based on cryptographic identities have is that digitally signed data can be passed through any number of untrusted systems and emerge intact. This ability to resist tampering makes it possible to broadcast signed data more widely than would otherwise be the case in a system that relies on a custodian to authenticate information.\n\nThe downside of this is that more untrusted systems have access to data. And if information is broadcast publicly, anyone can get access to it.\n\nThis problem is compounded by re-use of cryptographic identities across multiple contexts. A benefit of self-issued credentials is that it becomes possible to bring everything attached to your identity with you, including social context and attached credentials. This is convenient and can be quite powerful, but it also means that more context is attached to your activity, making it easier to infer information about you for advertising or surveillance purposes. This is dangerously close to the dystopian ideal of a \"Digital ID\".\n\nThe best way to deal with this risk is to consider identity re-use an option to be used when desirable, but to default to creating a new key for every identity you create. This is no worse than the status quo, and it makes room for the ability to link identities when desired.\n\nAnother possible approach to this problem is to avoid broadcasting signed data when possible. This could be done by obscuring your cryptographic identity when data is served from a database, or by encrypting your signed data in order to selectively share it with named counterparties.\n\nStill, this is a real risk, and should be kept in mind when designing and using systems based on cryptographic identity. If you'd like to read more about this, please see [this blog post](https://habla.news/u/hodlbod@coracle.social/1687802006398).\n\n# Making Keys Usable\n\nYou might be tempted to look at that list of trade-offs and get the sense that cryptographic identity is not for mere mortals. Key management is hard, and footguns abound - but there is a way forward. With [nostr](https://nostr.com/), some new things are happening in the world of key management that have never really happened before.\n\nPlenty of work over the last 30 years has gone into making key management tractable, but none have really been widely adopted. The reason for this is simple: network effect.\n\nMany of these older key systems only applied the thinnest veneer of humanity over keys. But an identity is much richer than a mere label. Having a real name, social connections, and a corpus of work to attach to a key creates a system of keys that _humans care about_.\n\nBy bootstrapping key management within a social context, nostr ensures that the payoff of key management is worth the learning curve. Not only is social engagement a strong incentive to get off the ground, people already on the network are eager to help you get past any roadblocks you might face.\n\nSo if I could offer an action item: give nostr a try today. Whether you're in it for the people and their values, or you just want to experiment with cryptographic identity, nostr is a great place to start.

I hope it's been helpful, and I can't wait to see you on nostr!\n\n","sig":"81b6b744454a733a8f2fb18b5b003258c1e0de7c153ab5a6a1182ce8f9174e11de7772eb53f1ce453ecfa0f6fbd471b829b44d13e5f9c7daed32d7eab230cdf6"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xyersd33xscrwwfhqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyztuwzjyxe4x2dwpgken87tna2rdlhpd02va5cvvgrrywpddnr3jyqcyqqq823cm8egsz":{"kind":30023,"id":"4d2c196866742da3cfce907885a9a209784f864f5513c0caadce1f0775774466","pubkey":"97c70a44366a6535c145b333f973ea86dfdc2d7a99da618c40c64705ad98e322","created_at":1741286290,"tags":[["d","1741286140797"],["title","A Guide for Relay-Based Group Implementations"],["summary","A guide for people who want to build clients for \"relays-as-groups\" that are compatible with Flotilla and Chachi."],["t","nostr"],["t","groups"],["t","community"],["t","nips"],["image","https://coracle-media.us-southeast-1.linodeobjects.com/yaopey-yong-gDT9TyhdT_I-unsplash.jpg"],["published_at","1741286289"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp978pfzrv6n9xhq5tvenl9e74pklmskh4xw6vxxyp3j8qkke3cezqqxnzde5xyersd33xscrwwfh5ekns6"],["t","federation"]],"content":"When developing on nostr, normally it's enough to read the NIP related to a given feature you want to build to know what has to be done. But there are some aspects of nostr development that aren't so straightforward because they depend less on specific data formats than on how different concepts are combined.\n\nAn example of this is how for a while it was considered best practice to re-publish notes when replying to them. This practice emerged before the outbox model gained traction, and was a hacky way of attempting to ensure relays had the full context required for a given note. Over time though, pubkey hints emerged as a better way to ensure other clients could find required context.\n\nAnother one of these things is \"relay-based groups\", or as I prefer to call it \"relays-as-groups\" (RAG). Such a thing doesn't really exist - there's no spec for it (although some _aspects_ of the concept are included in NIP 29), but at the same time there are two concrete implementations (Flotilla and Chachi) which leverage several different NIPs in order to create a cohesive system for groups on nostr.\n\nThis composability is one of the neat qualities of nostr. Not only would it be unhelpful to specify how different parts of the protocol should work together, it would be impossible because of the number of possible combinations possible just from applying a little bit of common sense to the NIPs repo. No one said it was ok to put `t` tags on a `kind 0`. But no one's stopping you! And the semantics are basically self-evident if you understand its component parts.\n\nSo, instead of writing a NIP that sets relay-based groups in stone, I'm writing this guide in order to document how I've combined different parts of the nostr protocol to create a compelling architecture for groups.\n\n## Relays\n\nRelays already have a canonical identity, which is the relay's url. Events posted to a relay can be thought of as \"posted to that group\". This means that every relay is already a group. All nostr notes have already been posted to one or more groups.\n\nOne common objection to this structure is that identifying a group with a relay means that groups are dependent on the relay to continue hosting the group. In normal broadcast nostr (which forms organic permissionless groups based on user-centric social clustering), this is a very bad thing, because hosts are orthogonal to group identity. Communities are completely different. Communities actually need someone to enforce community boundaries, implement moderation, etc. Reliance on a host is a feature, not a bug (in contrast to NIP 29 groups, which tend to co-locate many groups on a single host, relays-as-groups tends to encourage one group, one host).\n\nThis doesn't mean that federation, mirrors, and migration can't be accomplished. In a sense, leaving this on the social layer is a good thing, because it adds friction to the dissolution/forking of a group. But the door is wide open to protocol additions to support those use cases for relay-based groups. One possible approach would be to follow [this draft PR](https://github.com/coracle-social/nips/blob/60179dfba2a51479c569c9192290bb4cefc660a8/xx.md#federation) which specified a \"federation\" event relays could publish on their own behalf.\n\n## Relay keys\n\n[This draft PR to NIP 11](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1764) specifies a `self` field which represents the relay's identity. Using this, relays can publish events on their own behalf. Currently, the `pubkey` field sort of does the same thing, but is overloaded as a contact field for the owner of the relay.\n\n## AUTH\n\nRelays can control access using [NIP 42 AUTH](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/42.md). There are any number of modes a relay can operate in:\n\n1. No auth, fully public - anyone can read/write to the group.\n\n2. Relays may enforce broad or granular access controls with AUTH.\n\nRelays may deny EVENTs or REQs depending on user identity. Messages returned in AUTH, CLOSED, or OK messages should be human readable. It's crucial that clients show these error messages to users. Here's how Flotilla handles failed AUTH and denied event publishing:\n\n![Demo](https://coracle-media.us-southeast-1.linodeobjects.com/2025-03-06-flotilla-publish-failure.mov)\n\n[LIMITS](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1434) could also be used in theory to help clients adapt their interface depending on user abilities and relay policy.\n\n3. AUTH with implicit access controls.\n\nIn this mode, relays may exclude matching events from REQs if the user does not have permission to view them. This can be useful for multi-use relays that host hidden rooms. This mode should be used with caution, because it can result in confusion for the end user.\n\nSee [Triflector](https://github.com/coracle-social/triflector) for a relay implementation that supports some of these auth policies.\n\n## Invite codes\n\nIf a user doesn't have access to a relay, they can request access using [this draft NIP](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1079). This is true whether access has been explicitly or implicitly denied (although users will have to know that they should use an invite code to request access).\n\nThe above referenced NIP also contains a mechanism for users to request an invite code that they can share with other users.\n\nThe policy for these invite codes is entirely up to the relay. They may be single-use, multi-use, or require additional verification. Additional requirements can be communicated to the user in the OK message, for example directions to visit an external URL to register.\n\nSee [Triflector](https://github.com/coracle-social/triflector) for a relay implementation that supports invite codes.\n\n## Content\n\nAny kind of event can be published to a relay being treated as a group, unless rejected by the relay implementation. In particular, [NIP 7D](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/7D.md) was added to support basic threads, and [NIP C7](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/C7.md) for chat messages.\n\nSince which relay an event came from determines which group it was posted to, clients need to have a mechanism for keeping track of which relay they received an event from, and should not broadcast events to other relays (unless intending to cross-post the content).\n\n## Rooms\n\nRooms follow [NIP 29](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md). I wish NIP 29 wasn't called \"relay based groups\", which is very confusing when talking about \"relays as groups\". It's much better to think of them as sub-groups, or as Flotilla calls them, \"rooms\".\n\nRooms have two modes - managed and unmanaged. Managed rooms follow all the rules laid out in NIP 29 about metadata published by the relay and user membership. In either case, rooms are represented by a random room id, and are posted to by including the id in an event's `h` tag. This allows rooms to switch between managed and unmanaged modes without losing any content.\n\nManaged room names come from `kind 39000` room meta events, but unmanaged rooms don't have these. Instead, room names should come from members' NIP 51 `kind 10009` membership lists. Tags on these lists should look like this: `[\"group\", \"groupid\", \"wss://group.example.com\", \"Cat lovers\"]`. If no name can be found for the room (i.e., there aren't any members), the room should be ignored by clients.\n\nRooms present a difficulty for publishing to the relay as a whole, since content with an `h` tag can't be excluded from requests. Currently, relay-wide posts are h-tagged with `_` which works for \"group\" clients, but not more generally. I'm not sure how to solve this other than to ask relays to support negative filters.\n\n## Cross-posting\n\nThe simplest way to cross-post content from one group (or room) to another, is to quote the original note in whatever event kind is appropriate. For example, a blog post might be quoted in a `kind 9` to be cross-posted to chat, or in a `kind 11` to be cross-posted to a thread. `kind 16` reposts can be used the same way if the reader's client renders reposts.\n\nPosting the original event to multiple relays-as-groups is trivial, since all you have to do is send the event to the relay. Posting to multiple rooms simultaneously by appending multiple `h` tags is however not recommended, since group relays/clients are incentivised to protect themselves from spam by rejecting events with multiple `h` tags (similar to how events with multiple `t` tags are sometimes rejected).\n\n## Privacy\n\nCurrently, it's recommended to include a [NIP 70](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/70.md) `-` tag on content posted to relays-as-groups to discourage replication of relay-specific content across the network.\n\nAnother slightly stronger approach would be for group relays to strip signatures in order to make events invalid (or at least deniable). For this approach to work, users would have to be able to signal that they trust relays to be honest. We could also [use ZkSNARKS](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1682) to validate signatures in bulk.\n\nIn any case, group posts should not be considered \"private\" in the same way E2EE groups might be. Relays-as-groups should be considered a good fit for low-stakes groups with many members (since trust deteriorates quickly as more people get involved).\n\n## Membership\n\nThere is currently no canonical member list published by relays (except for NIP 29 managed rooms). Instead, users keep track of their own relay and room memberships using `kind 10009` lists. Relay-level memberships are represented by an `r` tag containing the relay url, and room-level memberships are represented using a `group` tag.\n\nUsers can choose to advertise their membership in a RAG by using unencrypted tags, or they may keep their membership private by using encrypted tags. Advertised memberships are useful for helping people find groups based on their social graph:\n\n![Discover](https://coracle-media.us-southeast-1.linodeobjects.com/2025-03-06-flotilla-discover-wot.png)\n\nUser memberships should not be trusted, since they can be published unilaterally by anyone, regardless of actual access. Possible improvements in this area would be the ability to provide proof of access:\n\n- Relays could publish member lists (although this would sacrifice member privacy)\n- Relays could support a new command that allows querying a particular member's access status\n- Relays could provide a proof to the member that they could then choose to publish or not\n\n## Moderation\n\nThere are two parts to moderation: reporting and taking action based on these reports.\n\nReporting is already covered by [NIP 56](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/56.md). Clients should be careful about encouraging users to post reports for illegal content under their own identity, since that can itself be illegal. Relays also should not serve reports to users, since that can be used to _find_ rather than address objectionable content.\n\nReports are only one mechanism for flagging objectionable content. Relay operators and administrators can use whatever heuristics they like to identify and address objectionable content. This might be via automated policies that auto-ban based on reports from high-reputation people, a client that implements [NIP 86](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/86.md) relay management API, or by some other admin interface.\n\nThere's currently no way for moderators of a given relay to be advertised, or for a moderator's client to know that the user is a moderator (so that they can enable UI elements for in-app moderation). This could be addressed via [NIP 11](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/11.md), [LIMITS](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1434), or some other mechanism in the future.\n\n## General best practices\n\nIn general, it's very important when developing a client to assume that the relay has _no_ special support for _any_ of the above features, instead treating all of this stuff as [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement).\n\nFor example, if a user enters an invite code, go ahead and send it to the relay using a `kind 28934` event. If it's rejected, you know that it didn't work. But if it's accepted, you don't know that it worked - you only know that the relay allowed the user to publish that event. This is helpful, becaues it may imply that the user does indeed have access to the relay. But additional probing may be needed, and reliance on error messages down the road when something else fails unexpectedly is indispensable.\n\nThis paradigm may drive some engineers nuts, because it's basically equivalent to coding your clients to reverse-engineer relay support for every feature you want to use. But this is true of nostr as a whole - anyone can put whatever weird stuff in an event and sign it. Clients have to be extremely compliant with Postell's law - doing their absolute best to accept whatever weird data or behavior shows up and handle failure in any situation. Sure, it's annoying, but it's the cost of permissionless development. What it gets us is a completely open-ended protocol, in which anything can be built, and in which every solution is tested by the market.\n","sig":"a5205b9168a04729b732e953a1068105be071de0c2f973da9e3a91bc275dcfa40bc8132a4cf81311ba319b3973ced4cee49aa54b37e83d5872a81bc3a49635d5"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xymrzwpjxumnydejqyxhwumn8ghj7mn0wvhxcmmvqgspy63faqvpc9nr4es3ec59wk9s3dr4e7qmxc6d6gmmsg6v6y6pnqgrqsqqqa28e0am5q":{"kind":30023,"id":"8667263b7b4fa70e85cd0cd6e40a9d9e9c79637847169aa2b2135e4a169aa686","pubkey":"126a29e8181c1663ae611ce285758b08b475cf81b3634dd237b8234cd1341981","created_at":1741634010,"tags":[["d","1741618277272"],["title","Cómo empezar en Nostr"],["summary","En caso de que aún no tengas una identidad Nostr, Nstart guía a los nuevos usuarios a través de un asistente sencillo y sin complicaciones, con consejos útiles sobre el protocolo:"],["t","nostr"],["t","hispano"],["t","2140meetups"],["t","malaga2140"],["image","https://cdn.nostrcheck.me/126a29e8181c1663ae611ce285758b08b475cf81b3634dd237b8234cd1341981/533c96f41724bf38c7b52b5eace13f0010d7c513c8749e9d894841ba9fd8974b.webp"],["published_at","1741634008"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqyn2985ps8qkvwhxz88zs46ckz95wh8crvmrfhfr0wprfngngxvpqqxnzde5xymrzwpjxumnydej7uw77p"],["p","7fa56f5d6962ab1e3cd424e758c3002b8665f7b0d8dcee9fe9e288d7751ac194"],["p","126a29e8181c1663ae611ce285758b08b475cf81b3634dd237b8234cd1341981"],["p","24e37c1e5b0c8ba8dde2754bcffc63b5b299f8064f8fb928bcf315b9c4965f3b"],["p","40b9c85fffeafc1cadf8c30a4e5c88660ff6e4971a0dc723d5ab674b5e61b451"],["p","61854976ba1a538b9dfed1b1df9b42e57602790e9354c59891be7b3713db637c"],["p","eab0e756d32b80bcd464f3d844b8040303075a13eabc3599a762c9ac7ab91f4f"],["p","a9434ee165ed01b286becfc2771ef1705d3537d051b387288898cc00d5c885be"],["p","50d94fc2d8580c682b071a542f8b1e31a200b0508bab95a33bef0855df281d63"],["p","f728d9e6e7048358e70930f5ca64b097770d989ccd86854fe618eda9c8a38106"],["p","6e468422dfb74a5738702a8823b9b28168abab8655faacb6853cd0ee15deee93"]],"content":"\u003e Si quieres saber más sobre Nostr antes de continuar, te recomendamos este enlace donde encontrarás información más detallada: https://njump.me/\n\n# Nstart\nPrácticamente cualquier cliente o aplicación Nostr permite crear una identidad o cuenta.

Creators, including writers, poets, bloggers, vloggers, and podcasters, make topics such as wallet security, the Lightning Network, and its impact on the economy, among others, more accessible and digestible. Think of voices such as Andreas Antonopoulos, whose tutorials have opened their doors to millions. On Nostr, a censorship-resistant protocol, creators venture into decentralized social media. They share technical tutorials and advocate for privacy. Their work not only educates but fosters a freedom culture of sovereignty.\n\nPublishers reinforce these messages. Nostr clients and bitcoin-only websites allow content to flourish without corporate censorship. Nostr is also decentralized, as everybody can host content by running a relay. This ensures that Bitcoin discourse remains censorship-free. A pertinent fact, given mainstream sites continuously censor voices for dummy reasons. By the way, did you know that cryptography was illegal until the 80s? Anyway, through the use of Nostr's protocol, publishers allow creators to reach audiences directly, supporting the ideas of decentralization and censorship resistance.\n\nInfluencers make bridges between special interest, tech and general audiences. Twitter personalities such as Lyn Alden simplify the value of Bitcoin. Nostr influencers emphasize its properties. They simplify intangible concepts and turn them into personal experiences. This leads to viral sensations and creates unity. Memes, threads, and AMAs humanize tech and make Nostr and Bitcoin available to everybody.\n\nWe don't have to worry about censorship or deplatforming anymore. We get the benefit of Nostr's strong network for outreach. Nostr grows through the [value-for-value](https://value4value.info) model via the Bitcoin Lightning Network. We create a feedback loop together. Content drives adoption, and adoption leads to further insights and creative ways to innovate.\n\nThe main issue content creators are faced with is monetization. So, why many still contracting with boring sponsors? We have better alternatives today than this old fiat-based monetization tactic. Let's call it _bitcoinization_ instead. Bitcoin's Lightning Network supports microtransactions, tipping, zapping and paid subscriptions. This provides a lot of backing to the new value-for-value model. Trust is a barrier too—publishers need to sort out quality content from noise. These are problems that lead to new solutions. Nostr web of trust (WoT) is an example of built-in reputation systems. Read more about it.\n\nAs both networks develop, empowering creators becomes our priority. Individuals are able to learn and donate sats with Lightning. Individuals also engage authentically or, in the best case scenario, run relays to host content themselves. Platforms combining Bitcoin and Nostr illustrate how interconnected these communities are. This cooperation allows these technologies to grow faster.\n\nContent creators, publishers, and influencers are the lifeblood of Bitcoin and Nostr. They turn code into culture, encouraging informed and resilient communities. Recognizing their contributions, such as support, engagement, or adoption, helps us build a stronger base for decentralization. Explore these ecosystems: support a creator, tip an educator, and most importantly, share their work with your family, friends, and communities. The future of open protocols depends on it you.\n\nFollow Nostr creators with your network.\n\nSupport Bitcoin educators via Lightning donations.\n\nBe willing to share your mind and opinions openly in order to break free from algorithmic tyranny.\n\nLet's bitcoin flourish, with nostr! Let's amplify together the voices defining our freer digital future. \n\nNow, I'm curious: who is a public figure or influencer who got you interested in Bitcoin? Or who gets you jumping and experimenting with a product or service you were on the lookout for? Does the product or service improve the way you leverage technologies like Bitcoin and Nostr?","sig":"b4ff1933f2ba973565369ddcc5e30a7f5bb7bdece215ad461505f5364dc267297cfff37e2d4a823323c1b045f7aa7989d9455802c3d11497f8962cc057fb6861"},"naddr1qqxnzde5xyurxdpjx5mnyvesqyxhwumn8ghj7mn0wvhxcmmvqgsxsvxyp9859gfckve32lqnpff48dq5nnrg8ckp33hqqn3zlutuv4grqsqqqa28z2pxhl":{"kind":30023,"id":"cc9ee53301c52f4562119b41a8e028415dff943787abcd11e28ee9e8ef8f3b12","pubkey":"6830c4094f42a138b333157c130a5353b4149cc683e2c18c6e004e22ff17c655","created_at":1741834436,"tags":[["d","1741834257230"],["title","The Gateway Keeper"],["summary",""],["t","artstr"],["t","nostr"],["t","shortstory"],["t","randomrumblings"],["image","https://editor-cdn.reedsy.com/books/64cb582cafd811fb6cce430d/images/81ca87a9b97d08dffdb7fc931a7e2820.jpg"],["published_at","1741834421"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzq6pscsy57s4p8zenx9tuzv99x5a5zjwvdqlzcxxxuqzwytl303j4qqxnzde5xyurxdpjx5mnyvesy4l9x7"]],"content":"An age unknown, on a brisk autumn evening, the Sun painted the sky with hues of orange and purple, as a lone figure made their way down the deserted Texas highway. The weary traveler, Jasper, had been driving for long hours - his car’s gas gauge fell perilously close to empty sign. As panic sets in, he spotted a small, weather-beaten gas station up ahead, its neon lights flickering like a beacon of hope. “Oh, that’s where I am going to take my next break”, He said to himself.\n\nRelieved, he pulled his car into the dimly lit station, the bluish-violet overhead lights casting an eerie glow over the pumps. The air smelled dusty and faintly of gas and motor oil, and the station’s exterior bore the marks of eternity of exposure to the elements.\n\nAs Jasper approached the rusty door of the station’s convenience store, he had a weird feeling and hesitated for a moment. “Something is not right in this place. It seems so different here.”, he thought to himself and pushed open the door. He was welcomed with the Feng-shui bells hung over the door.\n\nThe interior of the shop was a time capsule of the past, filled with shelves lined with dusty goods and retro advertisements. A grizzled old man stood behind the counter, his face lined with age and wisdom. He gave Jasper, a knowing nod as if he had been expecting him.\n\n“Evenin, son. Need some gas?” the old man asked in his thick southern accent, his voice raspy but warm.\n\n“Yeah, I am running on fumes,” replied Jasper, grateful for the help.\n\nThe old man shuffled to the register and handed Jasper the gas nozzle. “Fill ‘er up and come on back in when you’re done. I’ll ring you up.”\n\nAs Jasper fueled his car, he couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to this place than that meets the eye. The old man seemed friendly enough, but there indeed was a glint of mystery in his eyes, as if he held a secret from a parallel universe!\n\nWhen he returned to the store, the old man was waiting with a knowing smile. “You’ve got that look, son. Curiosity mixed with trepidation. Sit down, and I’ll tell you a tale that’ll make your hair stand on end. And give you some resolve to your mind’s doubts.”\n\nJasper settled onto a creaky stool near the counter, intrigued by the prospect of the story. He had a feeling; this was no ordinary gas station and that he was about to embark on a journey he could never have imagined.\n\nThe old man began his tale looking far away to the setting sun through the windowpane behind Jasper. “Long ago, this gas station wasn’t just a place to fill up your tank. It was a gateway to another realm, a place where the ordinary mingled with the extraordinary. Those who stumbled upon it found themselves drawn into adventures beyond their wildest dreams.”\n\nHe spoke of time travelers, lost souls and otherworldly beings who had passed through this very spot where Jasper was sitting. Jasper was captivated, his skepticism slowly fading as the old man’s words wove a tapestry of wonder and enchantment.\n\n“But with great power comes great responsibility,” the old man’s face hung down for a moment and continued. “As more people discovered this realm, they sought to exploit its magic for their own gains. Greed and darkness crept into the hearts of some, threatening to corrupt the balance between the worlds.”\n\nJasper’s mind raced with questions, and he could not help but ask, “So, what happened? Is this place still a gateway?”\n\nThe old man’s gaze grew solemn. “The gateway still exists, but its presence has faded over time. It only reveals itself to those who truly need and deserve it. Only to those who seek adventure, redemption, or a second chance at life.”, he continued. “If you are here and we are talking now, you were destined to be here. This place found you. Not that you found this place.”\n\nAs the night wore on, the old man shared more tales of brave heroes and humble wanderers who had passed through the very place, the mystical portal. Jasper found himself transported to different realms with every story the old man told, feeling a connection to these fabled characters he had never met.\n\nHours passed like minutes, and as the clock struck midnight, Jasper knew he had experienced something extraordinary. He thanked the old man for his captivating stories and promised to return someday.\n\nWith a tank full of gas and heart full of wonder, Jasper continued his journey down the winding highway. The neon sign of the gas station slowly faded away in distance, as he looked into the right rear-view mirror. It left him with memories that would stay etched in his mind forever. He again thought about the last few hours of his life. An unknown old man at an unknown town gas station, who in their right mind would sit and listen to stories for hours?! Or did all these really happened? Were those just my dreams? Weirdly enough, confused, and contented Jasper moved his focus to the road and pushed hard on the gas pedal - although he didn’t have any idea where he is going.\n\nIn the days that followed, Jasper found himself longing for the mysterious gas station and the tales it held within its walls. He could not leave the feeling that he was meant to be a part of something bigger, something magical.\n\nOver the next few years, Jasper became an avid traveler, exploring the world in search of solace, adventure and meaning. He encountered various challenges and met people from all walks of life, each with their own unique stories to share.\n\nOne fateful day, as Jasper drove through a remote stretch of desert, he noticed a faint glimmer on the horizon. His heart skipped a beat as he recognized the neon sign of the gas station, standing tall against the barren landscape.\n\nWithout hesitation, he turned the wheel off the highway and drove towards the flickering lights. As he entered the station once more, the old man behind the counter smiled, as if he had been waiting for Jasper’s return.\n\n“It’s been a long time, son,” the old man said with a hint of nostalgia.\n\nJasper nodded, feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension. “I couldn’t forget your stories. They’ve stayed with me all these years.”\n\nThe old man chuckled softly, “You were meant to hear them, Jasper. You were meant to be a part of this world, to carry on the tales and pass them down to next generation, until you find another YOU to hand over this responsibility.”\n\nJasper listened intently as the old man shared new stories, stories that spoke of hope, courage, and the enduring power of the human spirit. He learned that the gateway to the other realm had indeed become rare, but it still appeared to those who needed the most.\n\nAs months turned into years, Jasper embraced his role as a storyteller. He traveled the world far and wide, seeking out those who needed to hear the magic of the gas station’s tales. He shared stories of hope with the downtrodden, stories of bravery with the fearful, and stories of love with the brokenhearted.\n\nThe gas station became a meeting place for wanderers and dreamers from all corners of the world, drawn together by the threads of fate and allure of the unknown. And with every story told, the magic of gateway grew stronger, bridging the gap between worlds once more.\n\nJasper’s life took on a purpose and depth he had never imagined. He felt like a conduit, channeling the wisdom of the past and possibilities of the future. The gas station became a sanctuary, a place where the burdens of the world lifted and hope flourished.\n\nAs years passed, and Jasper traveled, he once again reached the gas station. Now grayed and wrinkled, Jasper walked into the gas station and the old man still there had the same welcoming smile on his face as before. But this time, instead of telling a new story, the old man said, “Be here, son.” and walked out of the door. Jasper waited for some time. But the old man didn’t return.

[Ditto](https://soapbox.pub/ditto/) is a step in the right direction for an alternate type of relay ecosystem that runs alongside the standard globally focused community we all know.\n\nWhile #Ditto is awesome, what I'd really like to see something similar, but more focused on a multi-community experience that simultaneously makes each community's viewing experience focused only on that community's content.  Just for fun, to write down some ideas, below are the 2 big changes that I think would make ditto the ultimate \"communities\" system that could trounce Reddit.\n\n### 1. Single relay experience on the domain: \nBy default, I think community sites should only show content from the built in relay (or a relay group for redundancy).  Currently on ditto.pub, when you first sign in, it feels a lot like any other web nostr client. The default home just shows follows I have from other relays instead of being thrown into the community content. You have to click the local feed, to filter the community's content, but it's limited to people who registered a NIP-05 for that domain.  I think that it would be great if you could contribute with any NIP-05 and it counts as community content. That could be accomplished by equate community content to content posted on the relay. There are countless apps to get a feed of your relays, so it doesn't benefit me to see it on a communty's domain.\n\n### 2. Sister client giving multi-community aggregation experience: \nI think communities should like pokemon and you grab the ones to identify with.  Create a set of web and mobile app clients that manage viewing and switching single relays at a time.  The client experience would be like reddit where you navigate ditto communities like subreddits.  If a community is a pokemon, then this is the pokedex? \nOK I actually don't know shit about pokemon so that might not be the slam dunk I thought it was. Whoops.\n\n### Ideas / more particulars\n* To see a community's content, you add a community relay subscribing to subreddit, or simply visit the domain.\n* Another great feature would be customizing the relays that make up your home feed, and making other named combo-feeds  (especially awesome if you are a part of 2 rival communities who's focus generally overlap)\n* The client would use more globally used relays to handle settings like your list followed ditto communities, etc (configurable)\n* Similarly, to help users find communities, ditto servers can optionally publish their relay info to a list on a \"discovery\" relay. Main popular discovery relays would be set by default (where communities publish discovery info to), but could be configured to other relays (if people wanted to set up custom curation relays or something.)\n* Registering a domain handle (NIP-05) at the community domain can be more focused on people with relay moderation roles, or just people who really for some reason want that community to be their whole identity (i don't personally get that, which is why mastodon is not for me)\n* Communities could work independently of the aggregator app(s) If people just wanted to visit the domain to post (from any NIP-05) \n","sig":"17ef1b5ee5844115054c977c70fd30d2b55416de603d611f5c21ce82c665325a586cd3bddee5b23ce191cef16c47bb096c8af8555b0c987f735c6bf158d2641c"},"naddr1qqxnzden8qer2desx5mnzv3cqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qjlrs53pkdfjnts29kveljul2sm0actt6n8dxrrzqcersttvcuv3qxpqqqp65wt57wh9":{"kind":30023,"id":"05980a4cf0ee74a7e1cf3a506ab5ec55c831cd7e39ec0b25f989540e44513c37","pubkey":"97c70a44366a6535c145b333f973ea86dfdc2d7a99da618c40c64705ad98e322","created_at":1738257337,"tags":[["d","1738257057128"],["title","What *is* a nostr app anyway?"],["summary","How to make the best, most impactful nostr apps by leveraging both the nostr network and the nostr protocol."],["t","nostr"],["t","nip89"],["t","app"],["image","https://coracle-media.us-southeast-1.linodeobjects.com/israel-palacio-ImcUkZ72oUs-unsplash.jpg"],["published_at","1738257323"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp978pfzrv6n9xhq5tvenl9e74pklmskh4xw6vxxyp3j8qkke3cezqqxnzden8qer2desx5mnzv3cs2k68w"]],"content":"There was a slight dust up recently over a website someone runs removing a listing for an app someone built based on entirely arbitrary criteria. I'm not to going to attempt to speak for either wounded party, but I would like to share my own personal definition for what constitutes a \"nostr app\" in an effort to help clarify what might be an otherwise confusing and opaque purity test.\n\nIn this post, I will be committing the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy, in which I start with the most liberal definition I can come up with, and gradually refine it until all that is left is the purest, gleamingest, most imaginary and unattainable nostr app imaginable. As I write this, I wonder if anything built yet will actually qualify. In any case, here we go.\n\n# It uses nostr\n\nThe lowest bar for what a \"nostr app\" might be is an app (\"application\" - i.e. software, not necessarily a native app of any kind) that has some nostr-specific code in it, but which doesn't take any advantage of what makes nostr distinctive as a protocol.\n\nExamples might include a scraper of some kind which fulfills its charter by fetching data from relays (regardless of whether it validates or retains signatures). Another might be a regular web 2.0 app which provides an option to \"log in with nostr\" by requesting and storing the user's public key.\n\nIn either case, the fact that nostr is involved is entirely neutral. A scraper can scrape html, pdfs, jsonl, whatever data source - nostr relays are just another target. Likewise, a user's key in this scenario is treated merely as an opaque identifier, with no appreciation for the super powers it brings along.\n\nIn most cases, this kind of app only exists as a marketing ploy, or less cynically, because it wants to get in on the hype of being a \"nostr app\", without the developer quite understanding what that means, or having the budget to execute properly on the claim.\n\n# It leverages nostr\n\nSome of you might be wondering, \"isn't 'leverage' a synonym for 'use'?\" And you would be right, but for one connotative difference. It's possible to \"use\" something improperly, but by definition leverage gives you a mechanical advantage that you wouldn't otherwise have. This is the second category of \"nostr app\".\n\nThis kind of app gets some benefit out of the nostr protocol and network, but in an entirely selfish fashion. The intention of this kind of app is not to augment the nostr network, but to augment its own UX by borrowing some nifty thing from the protocol without really contributing anything back.\n\nSome examples might include:\n\n- Using nostr signers to encrypt or sign data, and then store that data on a proprietary server.\n- Using nostr relays as a kind of low-code backend, but using proprietary event payloads.\n- Using nostr event kinds to represent data (why), but not leveraging the trustlessness that buys you.\n\nAn application in this category might even communicate to its users via nostr DMs - but this doesn't make it a \"nostr app\" any more than a website that emails you hot deals on herbal supplements is an \"email app\". These apps are purely parasitic on the nostr ecosystem.\n\nIn the long-term, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Email's ubiquity is self-reinforcing. But in the short term, this kind of \"nostr app\" can actually do damage to nostr's reputation by over-promising and under-delivering.\n\n# It complements nostr\n\nNext up, we have apps that get some benefit out of nostr as above, but give back by providing a unique value proposition to nostr users as nostr users. This is a bit of a fine distinction, but for me this category is for apps which focus on solving problems that nostr isn't good at solving, leaving the nostr integration in a secondary or supporting role.\n\nOne example of this kind of app was Mutiny (RIP), which not only allowed users to sign in with nostr, but also pulled those users' social graphs so that users could send money to people they knew and trusted. Mutiny was doing a great job of leveraging nostr, as well as providing value to users with nostr identities - but it was still primarily a bitcoin wallet, not a \"nostr app\" in the purest sense.\n\nOther examples are things like Nostr Nests and Zap.stream, whose core value proposition is streaming video or audio content. Both make great use of nostr identities, data formats, and relays, but they're primarily streaming apps. A good litmus test for things like this is: if you got rid of nostr, would it be the same product (even if inferior in certain ways)?\n\nA similar category is infrastructure providers that benefit nostr by their existence (and may in fact be targeted explicitly at nostr users), but do things in a centralized, old-web way; for example: media hosts, DNS registrars, hosting providers, and CDNs.\n\nTo be clear here, I'm not casting aspersions (I don't even know what those are, or where to buy them). All the apps mentioned above use nostr to great effect, and are a real benefit to nostr users. But they are not True Scotsmen.\n\n# It embodies nostr\n\nOk, here we go. This is the crème de la crème, the top du top, the meilleur du meilleur, the bee's knees. The purest, holiest, most chaste category of nostr app out there. The apps which are, indeed, nostr indigitate.\n\nThis category of nostr app (see, no quotes this time) can be defined by the converse of the previous category. If nostr was removed from this type of application, would it be impossible to create the same product?\n\nTo tease this apart a bit, apps that leverage the technical aspects of nostr are dependent on nostr the *protocol*, while apps that benefit nostr exclusively via network effect are integrated into nostr the *network*. An app that does both things is working in symbiosis with nostr as a whole.\n\nAn app that embraces both nostr's protocol and its network becomes an organic extension of every other nostr app out there, multiplying both its competitive moat and its contribution to the ecosystem:\n\n- In contrast to apps that only borrow from nostr on the technical level but continue to operate in their own silos, an application integrated into the nostr network comes pre-packaged with existing users, and is able to provide more value to those users because of other nostr products. On nostr, it's a good thing to advertise your competitors.\n- In contrast to apps that only market themselves to nostr users without building out a deep integration on the protocol level, a deeply integrated app becomes an asset to every other nostr app by becoming an organic extension of them through interoperability. This results in increased traffic to the app as other developers and users refer people to it instead of solving their problem on their own. This is the \"micro-apps\" utopia we've all been waiting for.\n\nCredible exit doesn't matter if there aren't alternative services. Interoperability is pointless if other applications don't offer something your app doesn't. Marketing to nostr users doesn't matter if you don't augment their agency _as nostr users_.\n\nIf I had to choose a single NIP that represents the mindset behind this kind of app, it would be NIP 89 A.K.A. \"Recommended Application Handlers\", which states:\n\n\u003e Nostr's discoverability and transparent event interaction is one of its most interesting/novel mechanics. This NIP provides a simple way for clients to discover applications that handle events of a specific kind to ensure smooth cross-client and cross-kind interactions.\n\nThese handlers are the glue that holds nostr apps together. A single event, signed by the developer of an application (or by the application's own account) tells anyone who wants to know 1. what event kinds the app supports, 2. how to link to the app (if it's a client), and (if the pubkey also publishes a kind 10002), 3. which relays the app prefers.\n\n_As a sidenote, NIP 89 is currently focused more on clients, leaving DVMs, relays, signers, etc somewhat out in the cold. Updating 89 to include tailored listings for each kind of supporting app would be a huge improvement to the protocol. This, plus a good front end for navigating these listings (sorry nostrapp.link, close but no cigar) would obviate the evil centralized websites that curate apps based on arbitrary criteria._\n\nExamples of this kind of app obviously include many kind 1 clients, as well as clients that attempt to bring the benefits of the nostr protocol and network to new use cases - whether long form content, video, image posts, music, emojis, recipes, project management, or any other \"content type\".\n\nTo drill down into one example, let's think for a moment about forms. What's so great about a forms app that is built on nostr? Well,\n\n- There is a [spec](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1190) for forms and responses, which means that...\n- Multiple clients can implement the same data format, allowing for credible exit and user choice, even of...\n- Other products not focused on forms, which can still view, respond to, or embed forms, and which can send their users via NIP 89 to a client that does...\n- Cryptographically sign forms and responses, which means they are self-authenticating and can be sent to...\n- Multiple relays, which reduces the amount of trust necessary to be confident results haven't been deliberately \"lost\".\n\nShow me a forms product that does all of those things, and isn't built on nostr. You can't, because it doesn't exist. Meanwhile, there are plenty of image hosts with APIs, streaming services, and bitcoin wallets which have basically the same levels of censorship resistance, interoperability, and network effect as if they weren't built on nostr.\n\n# It supports nostr\n\nNotice I haven't said anything about whether relays, signers, blossom servers, software libraries, DVMs, and the accumulated addenda of the nostr ecosystem are nostr apps. Well, they are (usually).\n\nThis is the category of nostr app that gets none of the credit for doing all of the work. There's no question that they qualify as beautiful nostrcorns, because their value propositions are entirely meaningless outside of the context of nostr. Who needs a signer if you don't have a cryptographic identity you need to protect? DVMs are literally impossible to use without relays. How are you going to find the blossom server that will serve a given hash if you don't know which servers the publishing user has selected to store their content?\n\nIn addition to being entirely contextualized by nostr architecture, this type of nostr app is valuable because it does things \"the nostr way\". By that I mean that they don't simply try to replicate existing internet functionality into a nostr context; instead, they create entirely new ways of putting the basic building blocks of the internet back together.\n\nA great example of this is how Nostr Connect, Nostr Wallet Connect, and DVMs all use relays as brokers, which allows service providers to avoid having to accept incoming network connections. This opens up really interesting possibilities all on its own.\n\nSo while I might hesitate to call many of these things \"apps\", they are certainly \"nostr\".\n\n# Appendix: it smells like a NINO\n\nSo, let's say you've created an app, but when you show it to people they politely smile, nod, and call it a NINO (Nostr In Name Only). What's a hacker to do? Well, here's your handy-dandy guide on how to wash that NINO stench off and Become a Nostr.\n\nYou app might be a NINO if:\n\n- There's no NIP for your data format (or you're abusing NIP 78, 32, etc by inventing a sub-protocol inside an existing event kind)\n- There's a NIP, but no one knows about it because it's in a text file on your hard drive (or buried in your project's repository)\n- Your NIP imposes an incompatible/centralized/legacy web paradigm onto nostr\n- Your NIP relies on trusted third (or first) parties\n- There's only one implementation of your NIP (yours)\n- Your core value proposition doesn't depend on relays, events, or nostr identities\n- One or more relay urls are hard-coded into the source code\n- Your app depends on a specific relay implementation to work (*ahem*, relay29)\n- You don't validate event signatures\n- You don't publish events to relays you don't control\n- You don't read events from relays you don't control\n- You use legacy web services to solve problems, rather than nostr-native solutions\n- You use nostr-native solutions, but you've hardcoded their pubkeys or URLs into your app\n- You don't use NIP 89 to discover clients and services\n- You haven't published a NIP 89 listing for your app\n- You don't leverage your users' web of trust for filtering out spam\n- You don't respect your users' mute lists\n- You try to \"own\" your users' data\n\nNow let me just re-iterate - it's ok to be a NINO. We need NINOs, because nostr can't (and shouldn't) tackle every problem. You just need to decide whether your app, as a NINO, is actually contributing to the nostr ecosystem, or whether you're just using buzzwords to whitewash a legacy web software product.\n\nIf you're in the former camp, great! If you're in the latter, what are you waiting for? Only you can fix  your NINO problem. And there are lots of ways to do this, depending on your own unique situation:\n\n- Drop nostr support if it's not doing anyone any good. If you want to build a normal company and make some money, that's perfectly fine.\n- Build out your nostr integration - start taking advantage of webs of trust, self-authenticating data, event handlers, etc.\n- Work around the problem. Think you need a special relay feature for your app to work? Guess again. Consider encryption, AUTH, DVMs, or better data formats.\n- Think your idea is a good one? Talk to other devs or open a PR to the [nips repo](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips). No one can adopt your NIP if they don't know about it.\n- Keep going. It can sometimes be hard to distinguish a research project from a NINO. New ideas have to be built out before they can be fully appreciated.\n- Listen to advice.

And anyway, roz is a NINO, since it provides value to nostr (potentially), but doesn't really do things in a nostr-native way. It also hard-codes its relays, and certainly doesn't use the outbox model or sign events. But that's ok, it's a proof of concept.\n\nA much better way to do this would be to modify roz to properly leverage nostr's capabilities, namely:\n\n- Use nostr-native data formats (i.e., draft a new kind)\n- Use relays instead of proprietary servers for data storage\n- Leverage nostr identities and signatures to decouple trust from storage, and allow trusted attestations to be discovered\n\nLuckily, this is not hard at all. In fact, I've gone ahead and drafted a [PR](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1737) to the NIPs repo that adds timestamp annotations to NIP 03, as an alternative to OpenTimestamps. The trade-off is that while user attestations are far less reliable than OTS proofs, they're much easier to verify, and can reach a pretty high level of reliability by combining multiple attestation sources with other forms of reputation.\n\nIn other words, instead of going nuclear and embedding your attestations into The Time Chain, you can simply ask 5-10 relays or people you trust for their attestations for a given event.\n\nThis PR isn't terribly important on its own, but it does remove one small barrier between us and trusted key rotation events (or other types of event that require establishing a verifiable chain of causality).","sig":"49eb5ecf8c2dcf622b85deace9a2076e54f36f8d07bad308832943468895e0db1508ac0d91886d15310a8f31cf2a4c66f8c30fbe5a27be92a2f7101e39ccc984"},"naddr1qqxnzden8y6rzvfkxg6rvdphqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qjlrs53pkdfjnts29kveljul2sm0actt6n8dxrrzqcersttvcuv3qxpqqqp65whnl42y":{"kind":30023,"id":"e99bc7e56ee82563f0eb1acb2a3b82182bebe518a3f7e9f7498e74854a7c3998","pubkey":"97c70a44366a6535c145b333f973ea86dfdc2d7a99da618c40c64705ad98e322","created_at":1739802540,"tags":[["d","1739411624647"],["title","Doing DVMs"],["summary","A brief walkthrough of what DVMs are, and how to build them"],["published_at","1739412082"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp978pfzrv6n9xhq5tvenl9e74pklmskh4xw6vxxyp3j8qkke3cezqqxnzden8y6rzvfkxg6rvdphrmylpl"],["published_at","1739412082"],["t","nostr"],["t","dvm"],["t","p"],["image","https://coracle-media.us-southeast-1.linodeobjects.com/stephan-valentin-r74II0tE7tc-unsplash.jpg"],["published_at","1739412082"]],"content":"Everyone knows that relays are central to how nostr works - they're even in the name: Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by *Relays*. As time goes on though, there are three other letters which are becoming conspicuously absent from our beloved and ambiguously pronounceable acronym - \"D\", \"V\", and \"M\".\n\nFor the uninitiated, DVM stands for \"data vending machines\". They're actually sort of hard to describe — in technical terms they act more like clients, since they simply read events from and publish events to relays. In most cases though, these events are part of a request/response flow initiated by users elsewhere on the network. In practice, DVMs are bots, but there's also nothing to prevent the work they do from being powered by human interaction. They're an amazingly flexible tool for building anything from custom feeds, to transcription services, to chatbots, to protocol gateways.\n\nThe hype cycle for DVMs seems to have reached escape velocity in a way few other things have - zaps being the possible exception. But *what* exactly DVMs are remains something of a mystery to many nostr developers - and how to build one may as well be written on clay tablets.\n\nThis blog post is designed to address that - below is a soup to nuts (no nutzaps though) guide to building a DVM flow, both from the client and the server side.\n\nHere's what we'll be covering:\n\n- Discovering DVM metadata\n- Basic request/response flow\n- Implementing a minimal example\n\nLet's get started!\n\n# DVM Metadata\n\nFirst of all, it's helpful to know how DVMs are reified on the nostr network. While not strictly necessary, this can be useful for discovering DVMs and presenting them to users, and for targeting specific DVMs we want a response from.\n\n[NIP 89](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/89.md) goes into this in more detail, but the basic idea is that anyone can create a `kind 31990` \"application handler\" event and publish it to the network with their own (or a dedicated) public key. This handler was originally intended to advertise clients, but has been re-purposed for DVM listings as well.\n\nHere's what the \"Fluffy Frens\" handler looks like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"content\": \"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Fluffy Frens\\\", \\\"picture\\\": \\\"https://image.nostr.build/f609311532c470f663e129510a76c9a1912ae9bc4aaaf058e5ba21cfb512c88e.jpg\\\", \\\"about\\\": \\\"I show recent notes about animals\\\", \\\"lud16\\\": \\\"discovery_content_fluffy@nostrdvm.com\\\", \\\"supportsEncryption\\\": true, \\\"acceptsNutZaps\\\": false, \\\"personalized\\\": false, \\\"amount\\\": \\\"free\\\", \\\"nip90Params\\\": {\\\"max_results\\\": {\\\"required\\\": false, \\\"values\\\": [], \\\"description\\\": \\\"The number of maximum results to return (default currently 100)\\\"}}}\",\n    \"created_at\": 1738874694,\n    \"id\": \"0aa8d1f19cfe17e00ce55ca86fea487c83be39a1813601f56f869abdfa776b3c\",\n    \"kind\": 31990,\n    \"pubkey\": \"7b7373dd58554ff4c0d28b401b9eae114bd92e30d872ae843b9a217375d66f9d\",\n    \"sig\": \"22403a7996147da607cf215994ab3b893176e5302a44a245e9c0d91214e4c56fae40d2239dce58ea724114591e8f95caed2ba1a231d09a6cd06c9f0980e1abd5\",\n    \"tags\": [\n        [\"k\", \"5300\"],\n        [\"d\", \"198650843898570c\"]\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis event is rendered in various clients using the kind-0-style metadata contained in the `content` field, allowing users to browse DVMs and pick one for their use case. If a user likes using a particular DVM, they might publish a `kind 31989` \"application recommendation\", which other users can use to find DVMs that are in use within their network.\n\nNote the `k` tag in the handler event - this allows DVMs to advertise support only for specific job types. It's also important to note that even though the spec doesn't cover relay selection, most clients use the publisher's `kind 10002` event to find out where the DVM listens for events.\n\nIf this looks messy to you, you're right. See [this PR](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1728) for a proposal to split DVMs out into their own handler kind, give them a dedicated pubkey along with dedicated metadata and relay selections, and clean up the data model a bit.\n\n# DVM Flow\n\nNow that we know what a DVM looks like, we can start to address how they work. My explanation below will elide some of the detail involved in [NIP 90](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md) for simplicity, so I encourage you to read the complete spec.\n\nThe basic DVM flow can be a little (very) confusing to work with, because in essence it's a request/response paradigm, but it has some additional wrinkles.\n\nFirst of all, the broker for the request isn't abstracted away as is usually the case with request/response flows. Regular HTTP requests involve all kinds of work in the background - from resolving domain names to traversing routers, VPNs, and ISP infrastructure. But developers don't generally have to care about all these intermediaries.\n\nWith DVMs, on the other hand, the essential complexity of relay selection can't simply be ignored. DVMs often advertise their own relay selections, which should be used rather than a hard-coded or randomly chosen relay to ensure messages are delivered. The benefit of this is that DVMs can avoid censorship, just as users can, by choosing relays that are willing to broker their activity. DVMs can even select multiple relays to broker requests, which means that clients might receive multiple copies of the same response.\n\nSecondly, the DVM request/response model is far more fluid than is usually the case with request/response flows. There are a set of standard practices, but the flow is flexible enough to admit exceptions to these conventions for special use cases. Here are some examples:\n\n- Normally, clients p-tag the DVM they wish to address. But if a client isn't picky about where a response comes from, they may choose to send an open request to the network and collect responses from multiple DVMs simultaneously.\n- Normally, a client creates a request before collecting responses using a subscription with an e-tag filter matching the request event. But clients may choose to skip the request step entirely and collect responses from the network that have already been created. This can be useful for computationally intensive tasks or common queries, where a single result can be re-used multiple times.\n- Sometimes, a DVM may respond with a `kind 7000` job status event to let clients know they're working on the request. This is particularly useful for longer-running tasks, where feedback is useful for building a responsive UX.\n- There are also some details in the spec regarding monetization, parameterization, error codes, encryption, etc.\n\n# Example DVM implementation\n\nFor the purposes of this blog post, I'll keep things simple by illustrating the most common kind of DVM flow: a `kind 5300` [content discovery](https://www.data-vending-machines.org/kinds/5300/) request, addressed to a particular DVM. If you're interested in other use cases, please visit [data-vending-machines.org](https://data-vending-machines.org) for additional documented kinds.\n\nThe basic flow looks like this:\n\n- The DVM starts by listening for `kind 5300` job requests on some relays it has selected and advertised via NIP 89 (more on that later)\n- A client creates a request event of `kind 5300`, p-tagged with the DVM's pubkey and sends it to the DVM's relay selections.\n- The DVM receives the event and processes it, issuing optional `kind 7000` job status events, and eventually issuing a `kind 6300` job result event (job result event kinds are always 1000 greater than the request's kind).\n- The client listens to the same relays for a response, and when it comes through does whatever it wants to with it.\n\nHere's a swimlane diagram of that flow:\n\n![DVM Flow](https://coracle-media.us-southeast-1.linodeobjects.com/dvmflow.png)\n\nTo avoid massive code samples, I'm going to implement our DVM entirely using nak (backed by the power of the human mind).\n\nThe first step is to start our DVM listening for requests that it wants to respond to. Nak's default pubkey is `79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798`, so we'll only listen for requests sent to nak.\n\n```bash\nnak req -k 5300 -t p=79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798\n```\n\nThis gives us the following filter:\n\n```json\n[\"REQ\",\"nak\",{\"kinds\":[5300],\"#p\":[\"79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798\"]}]\n```\n\nTo open a subscription to `nos.lol` and stream job requests, add `--stream wss://nos.lol` to the previous request and leave it running.\n\nNext, open a new terminal window for our \"client\" and create a job request. In this case, there's nothing we need to provide as `input`, but we'll include it just for illustration. It's also good practice to include an `expiration` tag so we're not asking relays to keep our ephemeral requests forever.\n\n```bash\nnak event -k 5300 -t p=79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798 -t expiration=$(( $(date +%s) + 30 )) -t input=hello\n```\n\nHere's what comes out:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": 5300,\n  \"id\": \"0e419d0b3c5d29f86d2132a38ca29cdfb81a246e1a649cb2fe1b9ed6144ebe30\",\n  \"pubkey\": \"79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798\",\n  \"created_at\": 1739407684,\n  \"tags\": [\n    [\"p\", \"79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798\"],\n    [\"expiration\", \"1739407683\"],\n    [\"input\", \"hello\"]\n  ],\n  \"content\": \"\",\n  \"sig\": \"560807548a75779a7a68c0ea73c6f097583e2807f4bb286c39931e99a4e377c0a64af664fa90f43e01ddd1de2e9405acd4e268f1bf3bc66f0ed5a866ea093966\"\n}\n```\n\nNow go ahead and publish this event by adding `nos.lol` to the end of your `nak` command. If all goes well, you should see your event pop up in your \"dvm\" subscription. If so, great! That's half of the flow.\n\nNext, we'll want our client to start listening for `kind 6300` responses to the request. In your \"client\" terminal window, run:\n\n```bash\nnak req -k 6300 -t e=\u003cyour-eventid-here\u003e --stream nos.lol\n```\n\nNote that if you only want to accept responses from the specified DVM (a good policy in general to avoid spam) you would include a `p` tag here. I've omitted it for brevity. Also notice the `k` tag specifies the request kind plus `1000` - this is just a convention for what kinds requests and responses use.\n\nNow, according to [data-vending-machines.org](https://www.data-vending-machines.org/kinds/5300/), `kind 5300` responses are supposed to put a JSON-encoded list of e-tags in the `content` field of the response. Weird, but ok. Stop the subscription in your \"dvm\" terminal and respond to your \"client\" with a recommendation to read my first note:\n\n```bash\nnak event -k 6300 -t e=a65665a3a4ca2c0d7b7582f4f0d073cd1c83741c25a07e98d49a43e46d258caf -c '[[\"e\",\"214f5898a7b75b7f95d9e990b706758ea525fe86db54c1a28a0f418c357f9b08\",\"wss://nos.lol/\"]]' nos.lol\n```\n\nHere's the response event we're sending:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": 6300,\n  \"id\": \"bb5f38920cbca15d3c79021f7d0051e82337254a84c56e0f4182578e4025232e\",\n  \"pubkey\": \"79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798\",\n  \"created_at\": 1739408411,\n  \"tags\": [\n    [\"e\", \"a65665a3a4ca2c0d7b7582f4f0d073cd1c83741c25a07e98d49a43e46d258caf\"]\n  ],\n  \"content\": \"[[\\\"e\\\",\\\"214f5898a7b75b7f95d9e990b706758ea525fe86db54c1a28a0f418c357f9b08\\\",\\\"wss://nos.lol/\\\"]]\",\n  \"sig\": \"a0fe2c3419c5c54cf2a6d9a2a5726b2a5b766d3c9e55d55568140979354003aacb038e90bdead43becf5956faa54e3b60ff18c0ea4d8e7dfdf0c8dd97fb24ff9\"\n}\n```\n\nNotice the `e` tag targets our original request.\n\nThis should result in the job result event showing up in our \"client\" terminal. Success!\n\nIf something isn't working, I've also create a video of the full process with some commentary which you can find [here](https://coracle-media.us-southeast-1.linodeobjects.com/nakflow.mov).\n\nNote that in practice, DVMs can be much more picky about the requests they will respond to, due to implementations failing to follow [Postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle). Hopefully that will improve over time. For now, here are a few resources that are useful when working with or developing DVMs:\n\n- [dvmdash](https://dvmdash.live)\n- [data-vending-machines.org](https://data-vending-machines.org)\n- [noogle](https://noogle.lol/)\n- [nostrdvm](https://github.com/believethehype/nostrdvm)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI started this post by hinting that DVMs might be as fundamental as relays are to making nostr work. But (apart from the fact that we'd end up with an acronym like DVMNOSTRZ+*, which would only exascerbate the pronounciation wars (if such a thing were possible)), that's not exactly true.\n\nDVMs have emerged as a central paradigm in the nostr world because they're a generalization of a design pattern unique to nostr's architecture - but which exists in many other places, including NIP 46 signer flows and NIP 47 wallet connect. Each of these sub-protocols works by using relays as neutral brokers for requests in order to avoid coupling services to web addresses.\n\nThis approach has all kinds of neat benefits, not least of which is allowing service providers to host their software without having to accept incoming TCP connections. But it's really an emergent property of relays, which not only are useful for brokering communication between users (aka storing events), but also brokering communication between machines.\n\nThe possibilities of this architecture have only started to emerge, so be on the lookout for new applications, and don't be afraid to experiment - just please, don't serialize json inside json 🤦‍♂️\n","sig":"bf0cefae527b807e94a5cffb855a5004907f584d95bace19d689d265a63cc246a8e8d6c8dfdc8a39bbdec7f846bb6a7843122f1cf779286e387f74013ac07500"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxc6rxdf3xccrzvf5qyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qtx0k0a7lw62vvqax6p3ku90tccgdka7ul4radews2wrdsg0m865sxpqqqp65w47u89l":{"kind":30023,"id":"acd9a133cb3249193a948bcf6f12fdd903ff42b4e626a379430fb7eb68d55931","pubkey":"599f67f7df7694c603a6d0636e15ebc610db77dcfd47d6e5d05386d821fb3ea9","created_at":1737889265,"tags":[["d","1736435160114"],["title","Guía: Blossom"],["summary","Blossom nos permite usar claves nostr como nuestras identidades para subir archivos a servidores de medios.

En lugar de nombres, se identifican por su hash [sha256](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2). La ventaja de usar hashes sha256 en lugar de nombres es que los hashes son IDs universales que se pueden calcular a partir del archivo mismo utilizando el algoritmo de hash sha256.\n\n💡 archivo -\u003e sha256 -\u003e hash\n\nBlossom es, por lo tanto, un conjunto de puntos finales HTTP que permiten a los usuarios almacenar y recuperar blobs almacenados en servidores utilizando su identidad nostr.\n\n## ¿Por qué Blossom?\n\nComo mencionamos hace un momento, al usar claves nostr como su identidad, Blossom permite que los datos sean \"propiedad\" del usuario. Esto simplifica enormemente la cuestión de \"qué es spam\" para el alojamiento de servidores. Por ejemplo, en nuestro Blossom solo permitimos cargas por miembros de la comunidad verificados que tengan un [NIP-05](https://nips.nostr.com/5) con nosotros.\n\nLos usuarios pueden subir en múltiples servidores de blossom, por ejemplo, uno alojado por su comunidad, uno de pago, otro público y gratuito, para establecer redundancia de sus datos. Los blobs pueden ser [espejados](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/04.md) entre servidores de blossom, de manera similar a cómo los relays nostr pueden transmitir eventos entre sí. Esto mejora la resistencia a la censura de blossom.\n\nA continuación se muestra una breve tabla de comparación entre torrents, Blossom y servidores CDN centralizados. (Suponiendo que hay muchos seeders para torrents y se utilizan múltiples servidores con Blossom).\n\n|                                                                 | Torrents | Blossom | CDN Centralizado |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- |\n| Descentralizado                                                 | ✅       | ✅      | ❌               |\n| Resistencia a la censura                                        | ✅       | ✅      | ❌               |\n| ¿Puedo usarlo para publicar fotos de gatitos en redes sociales? | ❌       | ✅      | ✅               |\n\n## ¿Cómo funciona?\n\nBlossom utiliza varios tipos de eventos nostr para comunicarse con el servidor de medios.\n\n| kind  | descripción                     | BUD                                                                |\n| ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 24242 | Evento de autorización          | [BUD01](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/01.md) |\n| 10063 | Lista de Servidores de Usuarios | [BUD03](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/03.md) |\n\n### kind:24242 - Autorización\n\nEsto es esencialmente lo que ya describimos al usar claves nostr como IDs de usuario. En el evento, el usuario le dice al servidor que quiere subir o eliminar un archivo y lo firma con sus claves nostr. El servidor realiza algunas verificaciones en este evento y luego ejecuta el comando del usuario si todo parece estar bien.\n\n### kind:10063 - Lista de Servidores de Usuarios\n\nEsto es utilizado por el usuario para anunciar a qué servidores de medios está subiendo. De esta manera, cuando el cliente ve esta lista, sabe dónde subir los archivos del usuario. También puede subir en múltiples servidores definidos en la lista para asegurar redundancia. En el lado de recuperación, si por alguna razón uno de los servidores en la lista del usuario está fuera de servicio, o el archivo ya no se puede encontrar allí, el cliente puede usar esta lista para intentar recuperar el archivo de otros servidores en la lista. Dado que los blobs se identifican por sus hashes, el mismo blob tendrá el mismo hash en cualquier servidor de medios. Todo lo que el cliente necesita hacer es cambiar la URL por la de un servidor diferente.\n\nAhora, además de los conceptos básicos de cómo funciona Blossom, también hay otros tipos de eventos que hacen que Blossom sea aún más interesante.\n\n| kind  | descripción           |\n| ----- | --------------------- |\n| 30563 | Blossom Drives     |\n| 36363 | Listado de Servidores |\n| 31963 | Reseña de Servidores  |\n\n### kind:30563 - Blossom Drives\n\nEste tipo de evento facilita la organización de blobs en carpetas, como estamos acostumbrados con los drives (piensa en Google Drive, iCloud, Proton Drive, etc.). El evento contiene información sobre la estructura de carpetas y los metadatos del drive.\n\n### kind:36363 y kind:31963 - Listado y Reseña\n\nEstos tipos de eventos permiten a los usuarios descubrir y reseñar servidores de medios a través de nostr. kind:36363 es un listado de servidores que contiene la URL del servidor. kind:31963 es una reseña, donde los usuarios pueden calificar servidores.\n\n## ¿Cómo lo uso?\n\n### Encuentra un servidor\n\nPrimero necesitarás elegir un servidor Blossom donde subirás tus archivos. Puedes navegar por los públicos en [blossomservers.com](https://blossomservers.com/). Algunos de ellos son de pago, otros pueden requerir que tus claves nostr estén en una lista blanca.\n\nLuego, puedes ir a la URL de su servidor y probar a subir un archivo pequeño, como una foto. Si estás satisfecho con el servidor (es rápido y aún no te ha fallado), puedes agregarlo a tu Lista de Servidores de Usuarios. Cubriremos brevemente cómo hacer esto en noStrudel y Amethyst (pero solo necesitas hacer esto una vez, una vez que tu lista actualizada esté publicada, los clientes pueden simplemente recuperarla de nostr).\n\n### noStrudel\n\n1. Encuentra Relays en la barra lateral, luego elige Servidores de Medios.\n2. Agrega un servidor de medios, o mejor aún, varios.\n3. Publica tu lista de servidores. ✅\n\n### Amethyst\n\n1. En la barra lateral, encuentra Servidores multimedia.\n2. Bajo Servidores Blossom, agrega tus servidores de medios.\n3. Firma y publica. ✅\n\nAhora, cuando vayas a hacer una publicación y adjuntar una foto, por ejemplo, se subirá en tu servidor blossom.\n\n⚠️ Ten en cuenta que debes suponer que los archivos que subas serán públicos. Aunque puedes proteger un archivo con contraseña, esto no ha sido auditado.\n\n### Blossom Drive\n\nComo mencionamos anteriormente, podemos publicar eventos para organizar nuestros blobs en carpetas. Esto puede ser excelente para compartir archivos con tu equipo, o simplemente para mantener las cosas organizadas.\n\nPara probarlo, ve a [blossom.hzrd149.com](https://blossom.hzrd149.com/) (o nuestra instancia comunitaria en [blossom.bitcointxoko.com](https://blossom.bitcointxoko.com)) e inicia sesión con tu método preferido.\n\nPuedes crear una nueva unidad y agregar blobs desde allí.\n\n### Bouquet\n\nSi usas múltiples servidores para darte redundancia, Bouquet es una buena manera de obtener una visión general de todos tus archivos. Úsalo para subir y navegar por tus medios en diferentes servidores y sincronizar blobs entre ellos.\n\n### Cherry Tree\n\nnostr:nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzqfngzhsvjggdlgeycm96x4emzjlwf8dyyzdfg4hefp89zpkdgz99qyghwumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2tcpzfmhxue69uhkummnw3e82efwvdhk6tcqyp3065hj9zellakecetfflkgudm5n6xcc9dnetfeacnq90y3yxa5z5gk2q6\n\nCherry Tree te permite dividir un archivo en fragmentos y luego subirlos en múltiples servidores blossom, y más tarde reensamblarlos en otro lugar.\n\n## Conclusión\n\nBlossom aún está en desarrollo, pero ya hay muchas cosas interesantes que puedes hacer con él para hacerte a ti y a tu comunidad más soberanos. ¡Pruébalo!\n\nSi deseas mantenerte al día sobre el desarrollo de Blossom, sigue a nostr:nprofile1qyghwumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2tcpzfmhxue69uhkummnw3e82efwvdhk6tcqyqnxs90qeyssm73jf3kt5dtnk997ujw6ggy6j3t0jjzw2yrv6sy22ysu5ka y dale un gran zap por su excelente trabajo.\n\n## Referencias\n\n- [hzrd149/blossom en GitHub](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom)\n- [Blossom Drive](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom-drive/blob/master/docs/drive.md)","sig":"c25f8f94be107888ada0b09dbd5b37ea6e89af94923261ca12406bcd49fdf16af381bb725ad4848867e81de0ff36b3c99f96bc4b45497ecc601b1281f348e316"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxccnjvf4xqmnqve5qyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3q5fxsepns3lw6xvqfq7slpzn9g6zxsef4gmte0h2ztck5dmq0gl8qxpqqqp65w4p0gmv":{"kind":30023,"id":"6124ed4194ad01a7fcd839d33f6ff406a02d8510fc815917062245c4c7b7f5e4","pubkey":"a24d0c86708fdda3300907a1f08a65468468653546d797dd425e2d46ec0f47ce","created_at":1736197559,"tags":[["d","1736191507034"],["title","Nuts for My New Era in Product"],["summary",""],["t","nostr"],["t","cashu"],["t","product"],["published_at","1736197548"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzpgjdpjr8pr7a5vcqjpap7z9x235ydpjn23khjlw5yh3dgmkq737wqqxnzdenxccnjvf4xqmnqve5dl5j3u"]],"content":"It's been nearly two years since I generated my Nostr npub, and I'm still blown away by its impact. Nostr has been THE catalyst for my rabbit hole journey, opening doors to new worlds and experiences.\n\nBack when I was trying to figure out how to handle my nsec, I was stuck in a rut. I'd founded and run a business for over a decade, but my passion had fizzled out along with it's revenues. Compound that with the accelerating decline in fiat and it was a depressing situation. It was time for a change, but I wasn't ready to burn the boat without a clear (or even general) direction.\n\nFast forward to today, and I've officially closed that chapter. I'm beyond excited to embark on this new journey into FOSS product, and 2025 marks the year I'm fully committed to this new path. It's taken longer than I wanted, but good things come to those who wait, right? And if I'm being honest, I have much more clarity, support and 100k never hurts as I start down this pursuit!\n\nMy journey from 2023 to 2025 has been a wild ride and I wouldn't change all that I had to slog through to get here. Recently as I've gotten back into the habit of checking in on Nostr I'm reminded why I fell in love so quickly, with its unique blend of humor, creativity, and innovation. \n\nNostr is a gateway for me to better understanding software engineers especially. It's incredible the amount of knowledge and PoW so many devs on Nostr have and it's humbling to even bounce around with you on this wonky protocol. \n\nThat constant experience made me want to put the effort and sats into attending the Lightning Summit at Bitcoin Park in the summer of 2023. And it didn't disappoint. I got to see up close so many talented devs tackling complex technical challenges with fearlessness and ingenuity. These pioneers are paving the way for future adoption, and I'm ready to dive in and help push the ecosystem forward with the skillset I have today and what I'm building in my toolbox for the future.\n\nMeeting fellow Nostr enthusiasts at Nosterville took my enthusiasm to another level in November 2023. It's like reigniting the excitement I felt when I first discovered the internet. It's mind-blowing to think about the potential this new protocol has to remake the web. 2024 I was much less active on Nostr as I was planning and taking the steps needed to move on in 2025. And now I'm finally ready to rock and roll.\n\nAs a product enthusiast, I'm stoked to help engineers get their projects ready for the masses. Let's make open source awesome, and let's get a ton of plebs on board!\n\nTo better contribute and build with developers, I'm committed to expanding my technical knowledge too. This includes learning the basics with GitHub to Python, Rust, AI, and ML. I'm also going to be switching to GrapheneOS as my daily driver and learning Linux. I'm eager to bring my product experience to the table and collaborate with others.\n\nGoing forward, I'm focusing specifically on helping build the Cashu protocol and how it intersects with Nostr and Lightning. \n\nIf you're a developer, especially one working on Cashu, I'd love to hear from you!\n\nHow can I assist with product-related tasks?\n\nI'm here to build and contribute to the growth of the freedom tech ecosystem.\n\nLFG.","sig":"a34bf42df0fd2b468781c50dd630d103c0871bd9e33ec21524f839bd8b30dae4fae0f36ed9228ecbabfa59af790e8e07996d0e2735616dbc5d4503506ed45a7e"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxcunzwp3xccngwfhqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qzsw6mhf4rapy9rfxpsrf9hza96jdkl74zsvhvr6qfxfpx80cpglsxpqqqp65wedzesd":{"kind":30023,"id":"317c4674cfdcd8341cd6512b6031e7c332bc37fef56451cb441aff09ce09b50c","pubkey":"141daddd351f42428d260c0692dc5d2ea4db7fd51419760f404992131df80a3f","created_at":1736918385,"tags":[["d","1736918161497"],["title","Nostr Echo Chambers: A Tool for Self-Programming"],["summary","On how Nostr allows users to create voluntary echo chambers, empowering them to curate their feeds as tools for self-programming and personal growth.

It’s associated with reinforcing biases, limiting perspectives, and fostering division. However, on platforms like **Nostr**, echo chambers take on a new, empowering dimension—one that allows users to consciously curate their own feeds and use them as tools for self-improvement and personal growth.\n\n## The Power of Voluntary Echo Chambers\n\nUnlike traditional social networks, where algorithms dictate what you see based on corporate interests or ad revenue, Nostr puts the power back in your hands. You choose the accounts you follow, the content you consume, and ultimately, the ideas that shape your thinking. This creates a **voluntary echo chamber**, one that reflects your personal interests and goals rather than the priorities of a centralized algorithm.\n\nThis concept ties into psychological principles like **autosuggestion** or **self-programming**. By surrounding yourself with content that aligns with your aspirations, you can subtly influence your thoughts and behaviors over time. For example:\n- Following accounts that discuss **Bitcoin** might deepen your understanding of it even if you are normally lazy to do your own research.\n- Subscribing to content about **meat eating** or **lifting** could motivate you to adopt those habits.\n- Engaging with posts about **self-discipline** or **personal development** might inspire you to take actionable steps toward your goals.\n\nScrolling through your Nostr feed becomes more than a passive activity—it becomes a form of self-conditioning. Each post you see reinforces the values and ideas you’ve chosen to prioritize, nudging you toward the person you want to become.\n\n## A Contrast with Traditional Social Media\n\nOn traditional platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or X, the feed is curated by algorithms designed to maximize engagement. These algorithms often prioritize sensationalism, controversy, or content that serves the platform’s business model. As a result, your brain is programmed not by your own goals, but by the interests of the corporation behind the platform.\n\nThis distinction is crucial. On Nostr, **you are the algorithm**. You decide what influences you, creating a space where your feed becomes a tool for self-improvement rather than a source of manipulation.\n\n## Echo Chambers as Positive Spaces\n\nThe idea of an echo chamber isn’t inherently negative. In fact, any group or community built around shared interests can be considered an echo chamber. Think about:\n- A **sports club**, where everyone encourages each other to train harder and improve.\n- A **book club**, where members discuss ideas that expand their intellectual horizons.\n- A **support group**, where people share experiences and motivate each other to overcome challenges.\n\nThese are all examples of echo chambers that people enter voluntarily, and they often lead to positive outcomes. The same principle applies to Nostr. By carefully curating your feed, you can create a digital space that motivates, educates, and inspires you.\n\n## The Key to Beneficial Echo Chambers\n\nThe difference between a harmful and a beneficial echo chamber lies in **intentionality**. On Nostr, you have the freedom to:\n1. **Choose your influences**: Follow accounts that align with your values and goals.\n2. **Avoid manipulation**: Stay clear of (mute) content that doesn’t serve your interests.\n3. **Adapt over time**: As your priorities evolve, so can your feed.\n\nThis level of control allows you to use echo chambers as a force for good—a way to program your mind for success, growth, and self-improvement.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nNostr represents a paradigm shift in how we interact with social media. By giving users the power to create their own echo chambers, it transforms the concept from something limiting into something liberating. Your feed becomes a reflection of your aspirations, a tool for self-programming, and a space for growth.\n\nSo, the next time someone criticizes echo chambers, remember: when entered voluntarily and curated intentionally, they can be one of the most powerful tools for personal development. On Nostr, the choice is yours.","sig":"a95ea4686661e075b184f4b95649432ed6e4fd5a11c685b0d3f7c4ac7e6f4f30ee7752f82e81b8c6ef0a20bc6ee29603bfb1176752333a509c994c3f19c83131"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxgenzve4xyurgvfkqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qjlrs53pkdfjnts29kveljul2sm0actt6n8dxrrzqcersttvcuv3qxpqqqp65wav0usv":{"kind":30023,"id":"83714b8e397795c0a615ae63700075abfabb3e202733342e92e90366e4cecf54","pubkey":"97c70a44366a6535c145b333f973ea86dfdc2d7a99da618c40c64705ad98e322","created_at":1732314991,"tags":[["d","1732313518416"],["title","Why not NIP 29?"],["summary","Why I didn't use NIP 29 to build Flotilla... and why I still might."],["published_at","1732313643"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp978pfzrv6n9xhq5tvenl9e74pklmskh4xw6vxxyp3j8qkke3cezqqxnzdenxgenzve4xyurgvfk9an8aq"],["t","nostr"],["t","groups"],["t","relays"],["t","nip29"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/c627d8da39158bac9e1ac4c4e163028f5cd4249f1622c78398d738937e49a093.jpg"],["published_at","1732313643"]],"content":"This week I finally released Flotilla, a discord/slack-like client I've been working on for about three months. This project began as a NIP 29 client, and after 3 PRs, lots of discussion, a podcast, and a partial implementation, I decided to go my own way.\n\nThis of course means that I broke compatibility with all the NIP 29 group clients out there, but I did it for good reasons. In this post I hope to explain those reasons, and speculate on how best to move forward with \"relay-based\" groups on nostr.\n\nTo give you some quick context, NIP 29 and my approach to groups (which I'll dub \"relays-as-groups\" for clarity) are very similar, with a fundamental difference. Both have chat, join requests, group metadata, membership, moderation, etc. However, the basic unit of a NIP 29 group is a random group id string, while the basic unit of a Flotilla group is a relay itself.\n\nI believe this design difference emerged in part because of what we were attempting to build. NIP 29 groups tend to be more telegram-like, where groups function more like chat rooms, and users join each one individually. On flotilla, groups function more like Discord servers, or Slack workspaces, and users join an entire group of chat rooms at once.\n\n\"Relays as groups\" has four major advantages over \"groups hosted by relays\".\n\n# Decentralization\n\nFirst, using relays as groups supports decentralization better than hosting user-managed groups on relays.\n\n(To be clear here, I'm not referring to client-managed groups, which is a whole different approach that we've experimented with in the past, both with NIP 72 communities and with [NIP 87](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/875) encrypted groups. Both NIP 29 and relays-as-groups solve many of the consistency problems associated with attempting to have a linear, synchronous conversation across multiple relays. While both alternatives have a story for migrating or mirroring a group, both rely heavily on the host relay to not censor user messages.)\n\nI know what you're thinking. How can _reducing_ the number of relays _improve_ decentralization? Relays were originally introduced in order to create redundancy and spread trust across many actors, creating censorship resistance. This model was difficult for many bitcoiners to wrap their heads around, because it's a very different kind of decentralization than what a blockchain delivers.\n\nCommunities are an essentially different use case from a broadcast network where content is delivered based on author or recipient relay selections. Every message to a community would have to be delivered to all members of the community. Sending each message to all members' personal inbox relays just doesn't make sense; there has to be some other inbox for the community to work off of.\n\nAdditionally, online communities almost always have moderators and admins. This is even true of very public, open types of communities, like subreddits. The only type of community that doesn't have moderators is one that emerges naturally from social clustering. And even in that case there is loose consensus about who is in and who isn't, based on the actions/follows/mutes of the participants, whether these clusters are huge or tiny. Socially-emergent groups are served well by chat applications or broadcast networks.\n\nBut the subset of online communities that do prefer to confer moderator status on certain members are _essentially centralized_. In other words, centralization and control is a feature, not a bug.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean there don't need to be considerations around credible exit and removing/adding moderators over time. But the fact is that moderator-led communities are always under the oversight of the moderators at any given time, even if the identity of those moderators changes and their power is limited.\n\nWhat this implies is that decentralization for moderator-led groups looks very different from decentralization for a broadcast network. There is nothing at all wrong with giving moderators full control over the group's communications (qua the group; DMs and public broadcast content between group members should happen outside the group's infrastructure, just as people also exist outside the communities they are a part of). What is important is that no one has control over groups that they aren't nominally the admin of.\n\nIn concrete terms, what this all means is that community moderators should self-host their infrastructure. This is the same principle as motivates self-custody and home servers, but applied to communities. If community leaders manage their own relays, this means that no hosting company or relay admin can de-platform their community. Centralization of network infrastructure in this case aligns with the trust structure of the group.\n\nApplying this to our group dilemma, it's easy to see that NIP 29 groups are more vulnerable to censorship or data harvesting attacks by malicious relay admins, since many unrelated groups might live on a single relay. In contrast, if you treat relays as groups themselves, every group is forced to live on a separate relay, spreading risk across more hosting providers.\n\nNow, this doesn't necessarily mean that many \"relays\" aren't \"virtual relays\" managed by the same hosting provider. So I'll admit that even \"relay-based\" groups don't completely solve this problem. But I think it will tend to nudge community organizers toward thinking about community infrastructure in a more self-sovereign (or community-sovereign) way.\n\n# Investment in Relays\n\nWhile both NIP 29 and relays-as-groups rely heavily on relays to implement the features that support each specification, there's an important difference between the feature sets. In NIP 29, relay support is specific only to groups, and isn't applicable to other use cases. In contrast, every protocol feature added to support the \"relays as groups\" can be re-purposed for other types of relays.\n\nTake join requests for example. NIP 29's kind `9021` events allow users to request access to a group, and that's all. [Kind `28934` join requests](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1079) on the other hand allow users to request access to relays. Which in the relays-as-groups model means group access, but it also means custom feed access, inbox relay access, maybe even blossom server access. In fact, kind `28934` was originally proposed at the beginning of this year in order to support a different version of hosted groups, but remains as relevant as it ever was despite iteration on groups.\n\nThe orthogonality of features added to relays to any specific use case will long-term result in simpler specs, and more interesting relay-based use cases being possible. Join requests are only one example. The same is true of 1984-based moderation, the proposed LIMITS command, AUTH, NIP 11 relay metadata, etc.\n\nWe already have web of trust relays, feed relays, archival relays, and [many more](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/issues/1282). Being able to request access to closed versions of these is useful. Being able to signal federation between multiple instances of these, run by different people, is useful. And of course, relay metadata, reports, and LIMITS are self-evidently useful for normal relays, since they pre-date Flotilla.\n\nI've always said that relays are some of the coolest and most under-appreciated parts of nostr. This doesn't mean that we should add every possible feature to them, but features related to data curation and access control fit really well with what relays are good for. For more on the role of relays and what features should be added to them, see my nostrasia talk [Functional Relays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-5DHymkfzw).\n\n# Declarative vs Imperative\n\nA common paradigm in programming is that of declarative vs imperative programming. Imperative programming focuses on \"how\" to achieve a given result, leaving \"what\" the code is doing to be inferred by the programmer. Declarative programming instead focuses on the \"what\", and allows some underlying implementation to solve the how. A good balance between these paradigms (and knowing when to use one over the other) allows programmers to work faster, make fewer mistakes, and produce less code.\n\nAnother way to look at this is that a specification should contain as much ambiguity as possible, but without compromising the system attributes the specification is supposed to guarantee. It can get complex when figuring out what attributes are core to the specification, since sometimes the \"how\" does actually matter a lot.\n\nHowever, nostr in particular falls pretty far along the \"declarative\" end of this spectrum because of its decentralized nature. The only person who can say anything with any authority is the person who signs an event. This event is a \"declaration\", and any effects it has are necessarily up to the relays, clients, and people interpreting the event. However, what others do with an event is an expectation that must be taken into account by the publisher, forming a feedback loop. This dialectic is what creates stability in the protocol.\n\nIn more concrete terms, no one can \"tell\" anyone else what they have to do by publishing an event like you might in a traditional, centralized RPC-type system. Any event whose semantics are a \"command\" rather than a \"fact\" or \"request\" is broken unless the counter party is fully committed to carrying out the command. An example of a \"command\" scenario on nostr is NIP 46 remote signing, in which the bunker is the agent of the user making the request. If the bunker implementation fails to carry out a valid command initiated by the user, its interpretation of that event is objectively incorrect.\n\nNIP 29 applies this same paradigm to relays, particularly in the area of moderation, membership edits, and group metadata. In other words, there are several \"commands\" which instruct the relay to do something.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does increase the number of things the interface between the client and relay have to agree on. A regular relay may accept an `add-user` request, but then do nothing with it, violating the contract it has implicitly accepted with the user. The solution to this is feature detection, which is a whole other API to be specified and implemented.\n\nMy ideal solution to this problem is to shift the semantics of events away from \"commands\" to \"facts\" - in other words, to make the interface more declarative.\n\nIn fact, we already have an interface for moderation that works like this. Many clients support kind `1984` \"report\" events. Users sending these reports have no expectations about how they will be used. They are a \"fact\", a declaration of opinion with certain semantics. Other actors in the network may choose whether or not to pay attention to these.\n\nThis same model is easily applied to communities. Without having to implement any feature detection (either for the relay's implementation, or for the user's role on that relay), anyone can simply send a \"report\". This goes into the black hole of the relay, and may subsequently be ignored, broadcasted, or acted on.\n\nThe really nice thing about this model is that because there is no expectation for \"how\" reports are to be interpreted, any approach to moderation can be used depending on relay policy or client implementation. In NIP 29, if you issue a `delete-event`, it either happens or it doesn't and if it doesn't, you have to explain the failure to the user somehow.\n\nIn the relays-as-groups model, e-tagging an event in a kind `1984` requires no user feedback, and therefore it can be interpreted however the relay prefer. This can result in insta-banning, manual review, thresholds based on number of reporters, a leaky-bucket social score algorithm, shadow banning, temporary banning, soft-moderation by allowing clients to request reports and respond to them by changing user interface elements, or anything else you can think of.\n\nThe reason I think this is important is that community moderation is a _very_ hard problem, and baking certain semantics into the specification can result in the complete failure of the spec. NIP 72 should be considered an example of what not to do. Some NIP 72 communities have survived due to the dedication of the moderators, but many more have failed because of the rigid moderation model. We should try not to make the same mistake again.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nNow, having said all that, I think there is actually a lot of value to NIP 29. What finally clicked for me this week after releasing Flotilla is that the two approaches are actually complementary to one another. One of the most common feature requests I've already heard for flotilla is to have more complete support for rooms, which are currently implemented as not much more than hashtags. Better rooms (i.e., \"nested groups\") would require: authentication, membership, moderation, and pretty much everything else that exists for the top-level group.\n\nAs much as I believe the relays-as-groups approach is superior to NIP 29 for top-level groups, it doesn't make any sense to try to \"nest\" relays to create sub-groups. Something like NIP 29 is needed in order to fully support rooms anyway, so I think the convergence of the two approaches is all but inevitable. In fact, fiatjaf has already merged a [PR](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1591) which will allow me to use the same event kinds in flotilla as exist already in NIP 29 clients.\n\nThere are just a few more changes that are necessary in order for me to fully adopt NIP 29 in Flotilla:\n\n- [NIP 29 feature detection](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1604)\n- [Opaque ids for unmanaged groups prevent unmanaged groups from having human-readable names](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1603)\n- [We need a mechanism for building membership lists without relay support](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1602)\n- [Better handling for `9021` group join requests](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1601)\n\nI've opened PRs for each of these (linked above). Hopefully we can work through these issues and combine our powers to become the Captain Planet of group implementations.\n","sig":"78aa0951cd2b2fc1bc07d256d10a3fb6b0ccbd16f213758f7f6fe7359ace4798da5f9756523d0f9011eeef687c14d6fd5139ff639b809ae71dce1351edb231b7"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxgunwvfs8qcnjdp5qyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3q5jnttpymeytm80hatjqcvhhqhzrhx6gxp8pq0wn93rhnu8s9h9dsxpqqqp65wcvn5n5":{"kind":30023,"id":"8a53e8a96b7f5e724d2ba69578988ea9380477434e751c06f1a4d282fc36f29a","pubkey":"a4a6b5849bc917b3befd5c81865ee0b88773690609c207ba6588ef3e1e05b95b","created_at":1732977037,"tags":[["d","1732971081944"],["title","Introducing the Echo PDAi Marked-1: The Future of Survival Technology"],["summary","Inspired by STALKER and built for the real world, the PDAi Marked-1 combines rugged design with cutting-edge offline technology.

Vamos a responder las siguientes: ¿Cómo car*jo guardo Bitcoin? O más bien, ¿cómo lo compro? ¿Cómo puedo estar seguro de que mi Bitcoin está bien guardado? Y la más frecuente: ¿puedo comprar menos de un Bitcoin?\n\nAntes de seguir, te comento que esta es la parte 2 del artículo anterior: habla.news/u/eltio@nostriches.net/1730422601977.\n\nVamos a incluir la venta, porque, si bien después de leer 100 artículos míos vas a entender que no vas a querer vender nunca, en una primera instancia es lógico que te preguntes cómo realizar posibles ganancias.\n\nComprar Bitcoin puede hacerse de diferentes maneras, dependiendo del país, sus regulaciones y el tipo de usuario, entre otros factores. Lo más usual es que un no-coiner empiece comprando Bitcoin en un exchange de renombre, como Binance, Bybit o Coinbase, aunque también hay quienes prefieren comprar de manera anónima utilizando exchanges de menor perfil, que no requieren KYC (Know Your Customer - regulación que obliga a los proveedores de servicios financieros a identificar al cliente). También puede realizarse la compra por fuera de los exchanges, de persona a persona, ya sea con conocidos, familiares o bien por medio de páginas que conectan compradores y vendedores. Incluso, si existen en tu país, podés ir a una “cueva” cripto (lugares donde se compra y se vende moneda extranjera por fuera de las garras del Estado).\n\nEn países donde la gente es dueña de su dinero, la compra y venta de Bitcoin suele ser tan sencilla como abrir una cuenta en un exchange (proceso similar al de abrir una cuenta bancaria o de red social) y utilizar una tarjeta de débito o crédito para comprar y vender, o bien transferencias bancarias al mismo exchange. Este no es el método preferido del bitcoiner porque carece de anonimato y está sujeto a impuestos y otras regulaciones.\n\nEn países financieramente más complicados, donde la tarjeta no funciona en el exchange o incluso bloquean ciertas transferencias por tratarse de una presunta compra de Bitcoin, se suele usar el método P2P, que puede hacerse en persona, en exchanges grandes, o en páginas dedicadas a esto. El comprador genera una orden de compra, le aparecen los datos bancarios del vendedor, transfiere copiando y pegando el CBU como lo haría para cualquier otra transferencia, y avisa al exchange o intermediario que ya realizó el pago. El intermediario (que tiene bloqueados los fondos del vendedor hasta que se resuelva la compra-venta) libera el Bitcoin a la cuenta del comprador. Para vender, es el mismo proceso, pero esperás la transferencia del comprador en lugar de transferir vos, y el exchange se ocupa de tomar el Bitcoin y dárselo al comprador cuando confirmás que ya recibiste el dinero en tu cuenta. Este método es un poco menos censurable que la compra-venta con tarjeta, pero también depende de un exchange que, en la mayoría de los casos, te va a pedir documentos y otros datos (KYC).\n\nPara transferir tu Bitcoin fuera del exchange (y también para ingresarlo en él si un día querés vender), es tan sencillo como copiar y pegar una secuencia de números y letras llamada “wallet”. Suele tener la forma: bc1qccq8c5revsvhamx5vqu0f6wpzjt5f2cem9ec7a. Vas al apartado de la página donde dice “retirar,” elegís Bitcoin como red y pegás tu wallet.\n\n¿De dónde sacás tu propia wallet? Buena pregunta. Podés comprar una billetera fría (método recomendado) o bien usar una billetera caliente gratuita (es decir, una app para PC, tablet o celular, aunque con ciertos riesgos). Yo te diría que empieces por comprar en un exchange un monto pequeño —sí, podés comprar 1 dólar de Bitcoin, no hace falta 1 Bitcoin entero— y lo mandes a una billetera caliente para empezar a familiarizarte con este mundo. Luego, cuando hayas comprado y enviado a esta billetera un monto que consideres digno de proteger con 100 USD, comprate una billetera fría. Sea cual sea la billetera que uses, asegurate de que te proporcione 12 o 24 palabras. Si no es así, el Bitcoin que pongas ahí no será tuyo, sino del proveedor de esa billetera (por eso es tan importante salir del exchange y tener tus 24 palabras). Recordemos que, para la red de Bitcoin, el dueño —y, por lo tanto, quien puede gastarlo— es quien tiene las palabras, no quien diga un gobierno que es el dueño.\n\nEntonces, el proceso sería el siguiente:\n\n- Descargar una billetera al teléfono y anotar las 24 palabras.\n- Crear una cuenta en una página de compra-venta de Bitcoin.\n- Comprar ya sea con tarjeta, P2P o el método que puedas.\n- Transferir del exchange a una billetera propia.\n- Cuando acumules un saldo importante, transferir a una billetera propia pero fría.\n\nListo, sos tu propio banco y un individuo soberano.\n\nAhora que sabés cómo comprar, guardar y vender (no te preocupes, en futuros artículos profundizaremos en tipos de wallets, exchanges y otras formas de adquirir Bitcoin), sigamos con la duda más frecuente: ¿solo 24 palabras? ¿Cómo sé que mi Bitcoin está seguro con eso? Antes de responderte, vuelvo a insistir en que leas el White Paper de Bitcoin, ya que en parte esto se explica, pero la respuesta corta es que tener esas palabras alcanza de sobra para estar seguro. Sin embargo, para quien no lo crea así o necesite soluciones más sofisticadas, existen billeteras multifirma y otros métodos que añaden capas extra de seguridad.\n\nHasta aquí el artículo de hoy. ¡Espero que te haya servido!\n\nSaludos,\n\nEl Tío","sig":"6dd0cd545e39edad3bcd7a5d58fa578396c83e5db5d557a8c1b3c34107c238e68791139faa98ade6818291f64f8eeeed5e74e7aebd9db91767c0b68af3de84b3"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxq6ryv3kxqcnjdehqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qpq0nkrqsyqa3ypq6fugerk7ry94ftd67ja7q2pchdxexnsqynzjsxpqqqp65w2k206z":{"kind":30023,"id":"4cddf661bc84ba26a62ec13ba2f6dc1c7dfad74029d056b7b8895b7a9ca786d0","pubkey":"081f3b0c10203b12041a4f1191dbc3216a95b75e977c05071769b269c00498a5","created_at":1730423758,"tags":[["d","1730422601977"],["title","Por qué CAR*JO quiero Bitcoin - Introducción al no-coiner"],["summary","Necesitás Bitcoin, aunque todavía no lo sepas."],["t","bitcoin"],["t","nocoiner"],["t","early adopter"],["t","nostr"],["t","p2p"],["t","red"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/dc10747d81c8f461e7e4f5e4abb5546657da4a55fb79a9fe50e49af014391502.jpg"],["published_at","1730423752"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqzql8vxpqgpmzgzp5nc3j8duxgt2jkm4a9muq5r3w6djd8qqfx99qqxnzdenxq6ryv3kxqcnjdeh3sn4cz"]],"content":"Después de escribir mi primer artículo en este blog me di cuenta (o mejor dicho, me hicieron darme cuenta) de que, si voy a escribir para *no-coiners* (término afectivo para referirme a quienes no poseen ni un Satoshi ni ninguna *shitcoin*), tengo que empezar por el principio. Antes de contarles lo difícil o lo ameno que puede ser su viaje en la red de Bitcoin, necesito contarles al menos qué carajo es, o por qué lo necesitan en sus vidas. Porque claro, este sitio donde escribo funciona con nostr, y tanto quienes escribimos aquí como la mayoría de quienes nos leen somos bitcoiners. Muchos estamos orientados a la tecnología o la criptografía, y todos nosotros hablamos de Bitcoin y su \"magia\"; nos entendemos entre nosotros y rara vez volvemos a las bases o nos tomamos el tiempo de explicar por qué el mundo necesita Bitcoin y, sobre todo, por qué cada individuo debería tener sus propias llaves. Solemos decir frases hechas como “not your keys, not your Bitcoin”, “have fun staying poor” o la famosa cita del mismísimo Satoshi: “Si no me crees o no lo entiendes, no tengo tiempo para tratar de convencerte, lo siento”.\n\nSatoshi (una persona o grupo de personas) publicó un documento de 9 páginas con el objetivo de crear un sistema de pagos entre personas, sin intermediarios de confianza. Una red P2P (peer-to-peer) o, en español, una red de pares. A diferencia de una red convencional, donde un servidor central controla la información y varios usuarios acceden a él, en una red de pares todos los nodos son iguales, y todos los nodos de Bitcoin guardan la misma información. En el white paper, Satoshi explicó en detalle cómo funcionaría la red y, unos meses después, lanzó oficialmente Bitcoin. Saltando 15 años de historia para tener material para futuros artículos (y también para evitar que te duermas leyendo), llegamos al presente: la red de pagos sin intermediarios es un éxito rotundo.\n\nResulta que yo no soy Satoshi, pero voy a tratar de convencerte, y hoy sí tengo tiempo para hacerlo.\n\nUn día como hoy se publicó el white paper de Bitcoin. Te recomiendo que, ahora mismo o al terminar de leer esto, le des una mirada. Puede que lo entiendas completamente o que no lo comprendas del todo, pero es necesario que lo intentes. Este \"papelito\" hermoso cambió la historia.\n\nYa hablaremos del cómo, pero lo importante es que funciona. Por primera vez en la historia, se ha logrado construir un dinero 100 % digital, que no depende de bancos ni de gobiernos, ni de empresas o personas individuales. Depende únicamente de la red y de las reglas pactadas hace 15 años, que son inamovibles: están escritas en piedra y reforzadas por miles de nodos individuales alrededor del mundo. Es la red más robusta del planeta y cada día crece más en usuarios, nodos y mineros. Bitcoin puede usarse para una infinidad de cosas: desde el propio dinero P2P que Satoshi proponía, hasta aplicaciones mucho más avanzadas, como la verificación de la transparencia en elecciones. Y, por si no ha quedado claro, repito: estamos ante la red más robusta del mundo. No criticaré a las altcoins en este artículo porque no es la intención, pero sepan que la red de Bitcoin deja obsoletas a todas las demás. Todo lo que hacen las altcoins puede hacerse en Bitcoin: más rápido, más barato y, sobre todo, más seguro. Entraremos en detalles de esto en otros artículos.\n\nVolviendo a la pregunta inicial: ¿por qué quiero Bitcoin?\n\nAhora ya sabemos que Bitcoin es la moneda de la red más segura del mundo y no depende de nadie. Pero por qué querés elegir una moneda que se respalda en una red y un protocolo y no en un gobierno? Puede que nunca te hayan confiscado los ahorros en un corralito, como en Argentina en 2001, o que nunca hayas experimentado la inflación desenfrenada como en Venezuela. Quizás no te importa que millones de personas no tengan acceso a una cuenta bancaria porque para vos los bancos son algo obvio y normal. Puede que estés viviendo con “privilegios financieros” y no te hayas dado cuenta... todavía. Bitcoin, al ser un dinero sin intermediarios ni custodios, y al no depender de ningún gobierno ni banco, puede ser almacenado por el usuario, quien es el único propietario de sus Bitcoin. Es inconfiscable, de ahí la importancia de la custodia y las llaves privadas. Además, la oferta total de Bitcoin en circulación es de 21,000,000 de unidades. Ni una más, ni una menos. Nadie, por más poder o influencia que tenga, puede imprimir más Bitcoin, ni inflacionarlo, ni devaluar tus ahorros. Por si fuera poco, Bitcoin es libre de censura: un cubano puede transferir Bitcoin a un argentino, o viceversa, sin importar las restricciones de capital en sus países. No se puede censurar una transacción de Bitcoin. Entonces, la respuesta corta a la pregunta es la siguiente:  \nNecesitás Bitcoin para protegerte de la inflación, de las restricciones de capitales y de los problemas bancarios. Y si estás pensando “para eso compro dólares, van abajo del colchón y listo”, te recomiendo que lo reconsideres, pero con este dato en mente: desde su creación hasta hoy, el dólar ha perdido más del 98 % de su poder adquisitivo. Mientras tanto, desde su creación hasta hoy, Bitcoin ha pasado de valer cero a ser una red de más de *one trillion dollar*. Quizás para ir ahorrando para el futuro sea mejor guargar Bitcoin que guardar Dólares. Mientras el dólar se fue desangrando año a año en cuanto a poder adquisitivo, Bitcoin ha pasado de no existir a ser comprado por individuos con alto patrimonio, fondos de inversión, empresas y hasta algunos países. ¿Todos están comprando Bitcoin menos vos?\n\nSi llegaste hasta acá y no te dió FOMO (miedo de quedarte fuera) el saber que todos compran menos vos, si no pensás que necesitás un sistema monetario libre de restricciones, inflación y estado, si no pensás que es necesario un dinero libre y un individuo soberano o bien pensás que tus dólares están tranquilos y seguros en el banco bueno, entonces si, HAVE FUN STAYING POOR. Si entendiste todo esto pero aún no logré convencerte de que Bitcoin es la única solución podés leer más articulos míos o de otros autores aquí dentro de habla.news y vas a encontrar muchísima información valiosa. Y no te olvides de leer el White Paper! \n\nGracias por llegar hasta aquí. Ojalá te sea útil. En mi próximo artículo hablaré sobre las diferencias entre comprar acciones, bonos o cualquier inversión tradicional y comprar Bitcoin. Spoiler: todas las acciones valdrán cerca de *cero* en términos de Bitcoin en 50 años.\n\nSaludos,\n  \nEl Tío.","sig":"3bf7032f00814e668f6da46225fa3d2142bf170eec7cbe918335433714e111a6aaf02464bbbad1afbd21cdcc8785b278a0501ceadb6138573671d23a2e5529f6"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxqenwv3j8ymrxvpsqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qpq0nkrqsyqa3ypq6fugerk7ry94ftd67ja7q2pchdxexnsqynzjsxpqqqp65wfk6q4j":{"kind":30023,"id":"fccc2d977727f2733a7cddc915da83c1fe943cc113bd02ca225280946664c136","pubkey":"081f3b0c10203b12041a4f1191dbc3216a95b75e977c05071769b269c00498a5","created_at":1730375535,"tags":[["d","1730372296300"],["title","Navegando las dificiles aguas de la custodia y el HODL"],["summary","Para facilitar la vida del HODLING no queda otra que leer y educarse."],["published_at","1730374067"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqhe0qx7z2ppyygsf424awdczv9pn9c0835w89hnu0jh54mrm86kuqqxnzdenxqenwv3j8ymrxvpszlsztl"],["published_at","1730374067"],["t","nostr"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","hodl"],["t","hold"],["t","custodia"],["t","ahorro"],["t","claves"],["t","inversión"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/5348f031b501756cd630f3591441fee21fa288e302cb5430497cf73104816942.jpg"],["published_at","1730374067"]],"content":"Muchas son las maneras de referirse a la compra y mantenimiento de Bitcoin en cartera. Muchas también son las maneras de almacenarlo. Y, aunque en realidad NADIE almacena Bitcoin, sino llaves privadas y llaves públicas, no es de mi interés entrar hoy en esos tecnicismos.\n\nHoy quiero escribirle a la gente de a pie, los trabajadores, emprendedores, empresarios y todo aquel que se interese por lo menos un poquito en su futuro y el de los suyos. Hay algo que todos los Bitcoiners sabemos pero que muchos de ustedes no lo experimentan hasta llevarse un buen susto en su primer año de inversión (Hablaré en todo el artículo de manera indistinta entre inversión y ahorro en Bitcoin ya que en el largo larguísimo plazo y mirando a Bitcoin como moneda pero también como activo, pueden utilizarse ambos términos). Lo que no saben los que miran desde afuera, es que muy poca gente compró Bitcoin en centavos o pocos dólares (o lo minó en épocas tempranas) y todavía lo mantienen en cartera. Me arriesgaría a decir que este numero de individuos no supera unos pocos miles. Muchos no-coiners creen que los bitcoiners compraron a dos centavos se durmieron 15 años y hoy son todos ricos, pero la mayoría de los early adopters, se hundieron intentando navegar las profundas y peligrosas aguas de la custodia y el HODL. \n\nPara quien todavía esté medio perdido y quizás este sea el primer artículo que lea, HODL es una manera \"chistosa\" de referirse a mantener Bitcoin en cartera, y se remonta allá por el 2013 donde un usuario quiso decir que estaba Holdeando (manteniendo) Bitcoin en cartera y lo escribió como HODLING. Pasó a la historia y hoy se usan HODL y HOLD de manera indistinta como chiste interno Bitcoiner.\n\nEn fin... Las profundas aguas... Holdear Bitcoin no es sencillo para las masas. Imaginate que tenés un activo en tu cartera, o compraste a 100 dólares y ahora vale 1.000. Lo venderías verdad? Y si vale 20.000 dólares? Ahí si lo venderías? Estarías multiplicando tu inversión como nunca. Bueno, a esa decisión se enfrentaron y se enfrentan TODOS los holders de Bitcoin más temprano o más tarde. Incluso aquel loco que compro por el 2017 en un precio de 20.000 hoy puede decidir vender y multiplicar casi por 4 su dinero en unos pocos años. Ni hablar de ese estresante momento que habías comprado en 69.000 dólares y lo viste bajar hasta los 17.000 dólares, unos cuantos meses de sufrimiento y temor... Más de uno se asustó de verdad y vendió todo, solo para verlo unas horas más tarde por arriba de los 20.000 y un año más tarde nuevamente en 70.000 dólares. \n\nSi bien no me gusta poner el foco en el precio, lo que intento ilustrar es lo DIFICIL que puede ser ver tu inversión en máximos o en mínimos y aún así decidir mantenerla unos cuantos años más. Es dificil, aún para los que viven su tercer o cuarto ciclo de mercado. Pero se hace más y más fácil a medida que uno avanza en el famoso \"rabbit hole\" de Bitcoin y empieza a entenderlo desde las bases, cada vez mejor. Este camino también es arduo, entender de Bitcoin requiere un poco de conocimiento en cada campo, hay que saber un poco de tecnología, un poco de redes, un poco de seguridad informatica, una pizca de teoría de juegos, una apasionante cantidad de macroeconomía, y hasta un interés genuino en lo que Mises llamó \"La acción Humana\". Y todo esto, uno lo va a prendiendo con ganas y de a poco sólo para llegar a la conclusión, meses o incluso años después, de que Bitcoin tiene que ser un activo por siempre en la cartera de uno, no se vende. Incluso hay quienes llegan al punto (como este humilde ser que escribe) que no poseen otro tipo de ahorro o inversión que no sean sus pocos o muchos satoshis en Billetera Fria.\n\nMi recomendación siempre será que DYOR, \"do your own research\", investiguen, lean, pregunten, únanse a #nostr que tiene la mejor comunidad del mundo a la hora de ayudar a otros usuarios, pero si no llegan a tener el tiempo de leer y progresar sólo tómenme estos dos consejos: \n\n- Háganse el tiempo para leer. \n- Stay humble y stack sats (De a poco y constante, todo ahorro mensual que uno haga, está mejor guardado en Bitcoin, siempre gastando menos de lo que ingresa esto no debería ser dificil).\n\nOtra dificultad que encontramos además de la parte emocional y humana relacionada con los precios y el desconocimiento, es la custodia. Cientos de personas perdieron TODO su Bitcoin por no saber almacenarlo correctamente. Decenas de maneras de almacenar claves y sin embargo muchos usuarios de Bitcoin no se sienten del todo seguro durante sus primeros años de inversión, y no están el todo equivocados... \nPor un lado puede ser tan sencillo como guardar 24 palabras. Por otro lado, puede no ser tan fácil, dependiendo del tipo de usuario. Entraremos en detalles de custodia en el próximo artículo. \n\nSaludos!\n\nEl Tío.\n\nPD: No es consejo de inversión.","sig":"dfcf6a4202ea9e0bac904a140205a7bcacd4514c1d91c60f3e1fc940da3ae308ceaef3b9d24bb0b120c4357b1cc2d36dbf70064cd7f86b7dd930ecf23dc4cd1a"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxqeryvpjxuenvvf5qyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qzuuajd7u3sx8xu92yav9jwxpr839cs0kc3q6t56vd5u9q033xmhsxpqqqp65wprczwt":{"kind":30023,"id":"d464efe10a084e96d5c850696c122d24754f8679c7d4bc7d55902f3bd53e41cc","pubkey":"1739d937dc8c0c7370aa27585938c119e25c41f6c441a5d34c6d38503e3136ef","created_at":1730221028,"tags":[["d","1730220273614"],["title","MLS over Nostr - Oct 29 2024"],["summary","A major milestone!

I know, with certainty, that MLS messaging over Nostr is going to work. That might sound a little crazy after so many months working on the project, and I was pretty confident, but until you’ve got running code, it’s all conjecture.\n\nLate last week, I released a video of a working prototype of [White Noise](https://github.com/erskingardner/whitenoise) that shows the full flow; creating groups, inviting other users to join those groups, accepting invites, and sending messages back-and-forth. I’m thrilled that I’ve gotten this far but also appalled that it’s taken so long and disgusted at the state of the code in the app (I’ve been told I have unrelenting standards 😅).\n\nIf you missed the video last week...\n\nnostr:note125cuk0zetc7sshw52v5zaq9apq3rq7e2x587tr2c96t7z7sjs59svwv0fj\n\n## What's Next?\nIn this update, I want to cover a few things about how I'm planning to proceed and how I’m splitting code out of the app into libraries that will help other developers implement MLS messaging in their own Nostr clients.\n\nFirst off, many of you know that I've been building White Noise as a Rust app using the [Tauri](https://tauri.app) framework. The [OpenMLS](https://github.com/openmls/openmls) implementation is also written in Rust (with bindings for many other languages). So, when you hear me talking about library code, think Rust crates for now. \n\nThe first library, called [openmls-nostr](https://github.com/erskingardner/openmls-nostr), is an extension/abstraction on top of the openmls implementation of the MLS spec that helps Nostr clients interact more easily with that implementation in a way that feels native to Nostr. Mostly this will be helping developers interact with MLS primitives and ensure that they’re creating, validating, and serializing these objects in the right way at the right times.\n\nThe second isn’t a new library as a big contribution to the already excellent [rust-nostr](https://github.com/rust-nostr) library from nostr:npub1drvpzev3syqt0kjrls50050uzf25gehpz9vgdw08hvex7e0vgfeq0eseet. The methods that will go in rust-nostr are highly abstracted and based specifically on the requirements of NIP-104. Mostly this will be helping developers to take those MLS primitives and publish or query them as Nostr events at the right times and to/from the right relays.\n\nMost of this code was originally written directly in the White Noise library so this week I've started to pull code for both of those libraries out and move it to its new home. While I’ve been at it, I've been writing some tests and trying to document things.\n\nAn unfortunate offshoot of this is that the usable builds of White Noise are going to take a touch longer. I promise it’s still a very high priority but at this point I need to clean a few things up based on what I've learned thus far. \n\nAnother thing that is slowing down release is that; behind the scenes of the dev work, I’ve been battling with Apple for nearly 2 months now to get a proper developer team set up so that we can publish the app via TestFlight for MacOS and iOS. I’ve also been recently learning the intricacies of Android publishing (oh my dear god there are so many devices, OS versions, etc.).\n\nWith that in mind, if you know anyone who can help get me up to speed on CI/CD, release pipelines, and multi-platform distribution please hit me up. I would love to learn more and hopefully shortcut some of the pain. \n\nThanks again so much for all the support over the last few months! It means a lot to me and is a huge part of what is keeping me going on this. 🙏","sig":"a88b076a12e1c10e5026f22b8d25737b91b94416af549ad80e96ed0887a0d951c6819b984457407ccdeb7f6b4eb31383e6f60d48e0fa237e31fdcb12a0326027"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxverzdp3xvcrxdejqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qc2p82fyndhk66hmz808c5pxjq8el60kh6jgj5xgdhmhksh69ktmsxpqqqp65wk9868a":{"kind":30023,"id":"09fd7c81432cca8068f10bb5277363db74ee3ce03dfd7f4621fbc39324591ef2","pubkey":"c2827524936dedad5f623bcf8a04d201f3fd3ed7d4912a190dbeef685f45b2f7","created_at":1734191870,"tags":[["d","1733214130372"],["title","Nostr: il cambio di paradigma"],["summary","quello che a Napoli in maniera geniale viene definito il fattoapposta!"],["t","nostr"],["t","wot"],["t","identità digitale"],["t","note"],["t","relay"],["t","nsec"],["t","npub"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/520d9dacdc1879b0d3e2d78babb5b09c4dd39af9d21b3e0c9a8843661b69b64a.jpg"],["published_at","1734130800"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzps5zw5jfxm0d440kyw703gzdyq0nl5ld04y39gvsm0h0dp05tvhhqqxnzdenxverzdp3xvcrxdejmg3wnj"]],"content":"\n## L’oggetto misterioso\nNostr, che in realtà è **N.O.S.T.R.**, il cui acronimo significa **N**otes and **O**ther **S**tuff **T**ransmitted by **R**elay, è un protocollo di comunicazione nato da pochissimi anni, che promette decentralizzazione e incensurabilità.\nLa maggior parte degli utenti internet non conosce il significato di queste due promesse, per motivi che non verranno analizzati qui (DYOR), ma **decentralizzazione e incensurabilità sono tanto importanti quanto la libertà che ne consegue**.\n\nDecidere di usare il protocollo Nostr è senz’altro facoltativo e dovrebbe essere preso in considerazione per una migliore conoscenza del web.

I have recently moved away from storing user keys in my apps due to the ease with which they could (and have) been put at risk. In doing so, I've discovered that despite its downsides, pasting your nsec into an app is a pretty straightforward operation which even non-technical people can pull off. In contrast, pretty much no other key management solution is.\n\nJust to state the obvious, and to kick off this survey of nostr key management options, let me just state that asking users to paste their nsec into your app is a *bad idea*. However good your intentions, this opens your users up to all kinds of attack vectors, including clipboard hijacking attacks, exposing keys to insecure communication channels, exposing keys to many different apps, supply chain attacks, XSS attacks, and yes, bugs that cause your software to send keys to analytics or error reporting backends.\n\nThe era of nsec-pasting is over.\n\nI've committed to embracing the pain and removing nsec login from Coracle, and I encourage other devs to do the same. The sooner we treat key management with the urgency it deserves, the sooner we can come up with a secure *and* convenient key management solution.\n\nAs an aside, `ncryptsec` is a great innovation for securely *transporting* keys, but it still doesn't protect against exposure to apps that need to *use* keys. It has its place though; in fact I'm of the opinion that `nsec` and seed words should be deprecated, and support for them should be removed. Giving friendly names and human-readable representations to data that is essentially private is a really bad idea (unless you're memorizing your key). But I digress.\n\n# Signer Comparisons\n\nLet's go through a few existing options for key management, and compare their relative merits. I've tried to list them in the order they appeared on the scene, which also helps to clarify the logic of how signers have evolved. Throughout, I will be focusing on what kinds of user experience each approach unlocks for *non-technical users*, since my goal is to build products that work for regular people.\n\n## Extension Signers\n\nThe first signer application (that I know of) was nos2x, by fiatjaf. As I understand it, this was a proof-of-concept of how users might protect their keys without releasing custody of them. And it works really well! In fact, even though there have been many forks and imitators, I still use nos2x when using nostr on my desktop browser.\n\nExtension signers offer a great user experience, along a narrow happy path. Setting up a browser extension is a relatively familiar process for normal users, and once it's done you don't really have to think about it. In theory, extensions can also include their own onboarding process and key backup strategies as well, allowing users to get started in a single place. Plus, there's very little latency involved in making calls to the signer extension.\n\nThis positive experience breaks down quickly though once a user wants to use a desktop or mobile application. When this happens, users have to start over essentially from scratch. Nothing they did to set up the extension helps them move to another signer application.\n\nWhile it's *technically* possible to use extension signers on mobile via e.g. the Kiwi browser, this doesn't work for native apps or apps installed as PWAs. Instead, you either have to revert to pasting keys, or use some other solution.\n\nOne slight permutation of extension signers is browser signers, like Spring. Instead of adding a signer to your browser, Spring allows you to install a browser that holds your keys and allows you to use any nostr web application. But this has all the same basic limitations that extension signers do.\n\n## Hardware Signers\n\nHardware signers came around shortly after extension signers. I'm not going to spend much time talking about them here, because although they're about as far along the spectrum towards security as you can go, they're also not very convenient. Non-technical users aren't going to onboard by buying (or building) a device which they have to connect to their desktop via USB whenever they want to sign a message. Hardware signers have their place, but onboarding isn't it.\n\nThe only hardware signer I'm aware of (although I'm sure I've heard of others) is from [LNBits](https://github.com/lnbits/nostr-signing-device), and is usually used via a browser extension like [horse](https://github.com/lnbits/horse). This of course means that it has all the same limitations that browser extensions have, and then some (although mobile and desktop apps would likely be able to find a way to talk directly to the signer).\n\n## Hosted Signers\n\nRemote signers (aka \"bunkers\") use the Nostr Connect protocol (also known as NIP 46) for remote signing.\n\nHosted signers in particular are one example of a NIP 46 remote signer, which lives on \"somebody else's computer\". Because they use a legacy web architecture, they can be built to be very familiar and convenient to users. It's trivial to build a hosted signer that offers email/password login along with 2FA, password resets, session revokation, the whole shebang. But they have one fatal flaw, which is that they are custodial. This means that not only do users have to relinquish exclusive control over their keys, but hosted signers also can become a target for hackers.\n\n## Desktop Signers\n\nSeveral projects exist which allow users to run their own bunker, on their own hardware. These include nostr clients like Gossip, as well as command-line utilities like nak. This approach is mostly an improvement over extension signers, because it widens the scope of applications that can conveniently access the signer from those that run in the browser to those that run on the desktop computer the signer lives on. The downside is that they have to communicate via relays, which either introduces latency or requires an additional component to be running locally.\n\nWhile it's technically possible to use desktop signers to log in on other computers or mobile apps, I don't think that's going to be very practical for most people. Mobile apps by definition are more portable than regular computers. Anyone who wants to access their nostr account on more than one device will have to either set up separate solutions, or go with another kind of remote signer. This isn't a huge obstacle for people highly invested in nostr, but it's a significant amount of friction for a new user.\n\n## Mobile Signers\n\nMobile signers solve the problem introduced by desktop signers of not always having access to your signer (or of your signer not having access to you, due to being powered down or disconnected from the internet). Mobile devices are generally more available than desktop devices, and also have better push notifications. This means that users can approve signer requests from any device as easily as tapping a notification.\n\nMobile signers on Android can also upgrade their UX by taking advantage of NIP 55 to avoid the round trip to relays, reducing latency and making it possible to sign things offline. [Amber](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Amber) has been a pioneer in this area, and other projects like [Nostrum](https://github.com/nostr-connect/nostrum) and [Alby's nostr-signer](https://github.com/getAlby/nostr-signer) have been prototyped.\n\nTo date, there unfortunately haven't been any signer applications released for iOS, which leaves the mobile signer story incomplete. In my opinion, this is probably the most promising solution for end users, although it's currently under-developed.\n\n## Web Signers\n\nOne interesting alternative that combines the benefits of hosted, desktop, and mobile wallets is [nsec.app](https://nsec.app). This is a web application frontend which keeps keys in the browser, so that they are never shared with a third party. Using web push notifications and a healthy sprinkle of black magic, nsec.app is able to respond to signer requests by opening itself in a browser window.\n\nThis works generally pretty well for desktop web applications, less well on android, still less well for android PWAs, and (to my understanding) not at all on iOS. Artur from nostr.band is working on these problems using a variety of approaches, one of which is embedding nsec.app in an iframe and communicating using `postMessage`.\n\nThis approach also makes it possible to sync keys between your phone and desktop, simulating a hosted UX by making them accessible from either location by signing in to nsec.app. This is done by encrypting user keys and storing them on the nsec.app server. In theory this should be secure, but it's something to consider.\n\nI'm cautiously optimistic about this approach. If successful, it would enable a single brand to exist on every platform, which is important to reduce unnecessary configuration and cognitive overhead for users.\n\n## Multisig Signers\n\nAnother experimental approach is multi-sig. [Promenade](https://git.fiatjaf.com/promenade) is a project by fiatjaf exploring this possibility. This would allow users to split their keys across different custodians and require all (or some majority of them) to approve an event signature before it would be valid.\n\nThe downsides of this are an increase in complexity (more moving parts for users to deal with) and latency (more parties to coordinate with to sign events). I'm also not clear on whether encryption is possible using multi-signature keys. If not, that would preclude not only existing direct messages (which will hopefully end up on MLS eventually anyway), but also things like private lists, mutes, and application settings. I think multi-signature signers are promising, but are definitely a long-term project.\n\n## Self-Hosted Signers\n\nComing nearly full circle, self-hosted signers are a special case of hosted signers, but, you know, self-hosted. These signers might live on a home server like a Start9 and be accessible for signer request approvals via tor, or they might live on a server run by the user (or an Uncle Jim). This would be an extremely convenient approach for anyone willing to deal with the complexities of hosting the infrastructure.\n\nA good candidate for NIP 46 support might be AlbyHub, which is already one of the easiest self-hosted wallets to set up and use. Adding signer suppport to AlbyHub would allow users to have their wallet and nostr keys stored in the same place, and accessible anywhere either via the web interface or via AlbyGo.\n\n## Omniplatform Signers\n\nThis leads me to, finally, \"omniplatform\" signers. This isn't really a new architecture, but a combination of several. User choice is great, but nostr has a very tight complexity budget when onboarding new users. If a brand can manage to get new users set up with a very simple but sub-optimal solution, then grow them into a more complete integration into the nostr ecosystem, that would be a huge win.\n\nI think Alby has a great shot at doing this, if it's something they want to prioritize. Bitwarden would also be a great candidate, since they already have apps on every platform, as well as a self-hosted option (Vaultwarden). If users could start with a mobile app, and incrementally set up a browser extension, self-hosted vault, and hardware signer as needed, that I think would be an ideal path.\n\n# Nostr Connect: broken, but promising\n\nIf you can't tell from the above comparison, I'm partial to NIP 46 as the best, most flexible way to build high-quality user experiences. Remote key management means a reduction in moving keys, hosting keys, and software installation and administration. If we can get users to the point where their keys live in only two places (their password manager and their signer), we'll be doing good.\n\nThere are however many ways to implement NIP 46. Implementing all of them in a single client (or signer) would be burdensome for developers, and introduce a lot of UI complexity to users. Here's a quick survey of flows that currently exist.\n\n## Signer -\u003e Client\n\nThe simplest way to connect a client and a bunker is for a user to explicitly authorize the connection by copying a `bunker://` URL from their signer application to their client. This allows the bunker to generate and validate a secret embedded in the URL without the client having to do anything other than pass it along in the initial `connect` request.\n\nThis is a great UX for people who know what they're doing, but isn't at all friendly to newcomers. Someone signing in for the first time isn't going to know what a bunker link is, and even if they do they're immediately confronted with the problem of picking a signer, setting it up, and finding out where in that app they can obtain a bunker link. This can be marginally smoothed out using things like protocol handlers and QR codes, but these won't apply in all (or even most) cases.\n\n## Client -\u003e Signer\n\nThe reverse flow is similar. This relies on the user to explicitly authorize the connection by copying a `nostrconnect://` url from the client into the signer app. In technical terms, this requires one fewer step, since in NIP 46 the connection is always initiated by the client. In this case, the pasting of the URL replaces the `connect` request. The client listens for a response containing a client-generated secret embedded in the `nostrconnect://` url. This step isn't currently supported by all signer apps, some of which return an `ack` instead. This can result in session hijacking, where an attacker can intercept signing requests (although they can't do anything that would require the user's key, like decrypting messages).\n\nWhile at first glance `nostrconnect` seems functionally identical to `bunker` links, the UX has the potential to be much better. The reason for this has to do with how people use which devices, and where a client or signer application is most likely to be run. This requires making some assumptions, but in my mind the most common scenario is that a user will want to host their signer on their phone, since that is the device that is most universally available for authorizations (apart from an always-online hosted signer on the open internet). In other words, users generally have their phones with them when they're using their computer, but often don't have a desktop available when using their phone. This idea is validated by (for example) the prevalence of SMS-based 2FA, which assumes the presence of a phone.\n\nAssuming the signer is on the user's phone, QR-scan flows for client authorization make a lot more sense if the client is the one generating the link, since they can simply scan a code generated on another device with their camera, or copy/paste or use a protocol handler for a client on the same device. In contrast, when using a `bunker` link users might find themselves in the awkward position of having to copy a link from their phone to their desktop. Whether this is done via QR code or by sending yourself a link via DM/text/email, it's an awkward flow most people aren't really prepared for.\n\n## Auto-Connect\n\nSome enhancements have been made to the bunker flow which allow clients to send an initial `connect` request without asking the user to copy links between apps. These allow clients to do away with opaque magic strings entirely and provide the idealized \"just one click\" flow. However, after trying to make this flow work over the course of a couple weeks, I've come to the opinion that the additional complexity involved in automating the flow just isn't worth it.\n\nThere are a few variants of this \"auto-connect\" flow:\n\n- Signer NIP-05: Signers can register a NIP 05 address for a user's pubkey on their domain, allowing users to enter their address rather than their pubkey on login. Unfortunately, this address has no relation to their actual NIP 05 address, which can result in a lot of confusion.\n- User NIP-05: To solve this problem, fiatjaf has proposed [a new version](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1578) which allows users to enter their own NIP 05 in at login instead of the one provided by the signer. The client would then look up the user's `10046` event and follow the signer pubkey listed there.\n- Nostrconnect handler: Signers may publish a NIP 89 handler which includes a handler url that clients can send `nostrconnect` urls to. This isn't currently specified anywhere, but it is supported by nsec.app. This bypasses the NIP 05 address requirement entirely, allowing users to simply pick a signer and click a button.\n\nEach of these flows have their own strengths and weaknesses, but all of them share a dependency on some external source of truth for routing a user to the correct bunker.\n\nIn the first case, this is done by remembering the NIP 05 address assigned by the signer, which relies on DNS and on users to not forget which address they're using.\n\nIn the second case, this is done by relying on the user having done a significant amount of configuration (setting up a NIP 05, adding it to their kind 0, and having published a `10046` event) which may or may not exist. This forces clients to gracefully degrade to some alternative login method anyway, and adds UX friction since users have to choose which interface will work for them.\n\nThe final method bypasses the need for users to remember their NIP 05 address, but it does require either the client or the user to select a trusted signer. If poorly implemented, this could result in users choosing an untrustworthy signer on signup (risking their keys), or the wrong signer on login resulting in a broken session.\n\nFor all these reasons, I've opted to go with the vanilla bunker/nostrconnect flow, which allows me to display a simple interface to users. Presenting a QR code without comment assumes that users know what to do with it, but the benefit is that it makes explicit the signer selection step which the auto-connect flows try to paper over. This is actually a good thing, because instead of using heuristics like addresses or lists of signers presented by a client to make the decision, users can choose based on which app they actually have installed, which is a richer mnemonic device.\n\n# Making NIP 46 Work\n\nThe bottom line here is that while NIP 46 is the best baseline for signer support, it doesn't currently work very well at all. There are a variety of reasons for this:\n\n- The specification itself isn't clear, and is constantly changing. This leads to incompatibilities between apps and signers (or explosive complexity in trying to handle every case).\n- Extensions to the basic bunker flow (both in terms of signer implementation and signer discovery) are worth researching, but each one creates another dimension of possible incompatibility. Signers will be incentivized to support every possible login flow, creating complexity for users and increasing attack surface area. Clients will have to implement fallbacks to their preferred signup flows, again resulting in UX complexity.\n- Clients don't currently deal well with latency. In order for NIP 46 to work smoothly, clients will have to implement better loading, debouncing, optimistic updates, publish status, and \"undo\". There are downsides to this, but many of these features endu up being built by mature software products anyway, so supporting these patterns may actually improve rather than degrade UX.\n- There's currently no easy and secure way for users to store keys in a single signer which they can access anywhere. This means that users have to set up multiple bunkers depending where they're sitting, or resort to alternative login methods like NIP 07 or 55. These are great upgrades, since they reduce latency and bandwidth use, but shouldn't be required for new users to learn.\n- There's no unified experience across platforms. If a user signs up on their desktop, how do they safely transfer their keys to their Android signer app? If they're given seed words, how can they import them as an nsec? Consensus on best practices would be an improvement, but I think only a unified UX across platforms for a single signer can really solve this.\n- As nice as it might be to bypass app stores and built-in push notifications, shunning traditional platforms drastically increases the friction for users. To my knowledge, no signer app currently exists in traditional app stores, or supports built-in push notifications. If we want nostr to be accessible to non-technical folks, we can't ask them to start by downloading Obtanium or zap.store and a UnifiedPush distributor for their platform.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I don't think NIP 46 will ever be the only solution for signers. But I do think it's a great baseline on which to build a kind of \"progressive enhancement\" approach. For example, clients should support at least nostrconnect/bunker links, and encourage users once they've logged in to upgrade to NIP 55 or NIP 07 signers. Signers should exist in the mainstream app store and use native push notifications, with an option to install elsewhere or opt-in to UnifiedPush.\n\nThe goal here is to balance user experience and security. The number one rule for this is to reduce attack vectors for obtaining user keys. This points to (ideally) a single non-custodial signer, easily accessible to the user, and a simple protocol for using that signer from any app. Progressive enhancement is fine, but we should always be able to fall back to this baseline.\n","sig":"956e1a35068e0654782997eacb174d4e8e590707b82499f245a45c03bdd2bcb0726f76caa1beb6ec391c1564591a8f9efec98e097736e295a3d70d96a282007f"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxyunjvfkxsmrjdehqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qcj8znuztfqkvq89pl8hceph0svvvqk0qay6nydgk9uyq7fhpfsgsxpqqqp65wkeksnh":{"kind":30023,"id":"909ba76c34ab91f2a91ba79877a0638d5c9a3aa9ecb38d43bb31a37087cd3943","pubkey":"c48e29f04b482cc01ca1f9ef8c86ef8318c059e0e9353235162f080f26e14c11","created_at":1731993361,"tags":[["d","1731991646977"],["title","HIGHLIGHT THIS TRANSCRIPT (Hodl x Erik Cason)"],["summary","An experiment where I publish a full transcript from THE Bitcoin Podcast and people highlight it, creating new Nostr events which earn them zaps while simultaneously giving my podcast more exposure.

I also just hate doing this because it takes time and I don't think anyone actually reads them on my website or on my Substack. And Substack is a centralized shithole anyway.\n\nBut I've been thinking... **It would make a lot more sense to just publish the summaries and full transcripts directly on Nostr so people can search and highlight the text more easily, with each highlight creating a brand new Nostr event.** I'll also post the quotes I've already pulled from the episode in a section at the top, which will give people a taste of what they can expect in addition to giving them some low-hanging-fruit for highlighting. Most obviously, publishing on Nostr means I just need to publish ONCE and my post will be available to everyone on whatever client they use (huzzah for open protocols and fuck Substack).\n\n**There are a few benefits to this Nostr-focused approach:**\n\n1. People can easily search the full text transcripts and find quotes they find meaningful/funny/fucked up/insightful/etc.\n2. When they create a highlight, they publish a new Nostr event which people can zap. People are incentivized to find the most valuable quotes because people like getting zapped.\n3. If people see highlights they find valuable, they'll come check out the full version of the show notes and subsequently watch/listen to the episodes, in addition to searching the transcript for their own highlight-able material (more zaps ensue). Maybe they even use the transcript as they listen to the episode and highlight as they go. Who knows?!\n4. As a content creator, I now have a new way to discover what parts of the episode speak to people most because I can see what people choose to highlight, and which highlights people choose to zap. This helps me decide which parts of an episode will make for the highest-signal short-form video clips, and of finding fire quotes I may have missed on my first pass-through. The highlights become a way to crowdsource signal and filter noise.\n5. The episodes become more interactive as new conversations pop up around Nostr based on different highlights. Nostr events are created, thoughts are provoked, zaps are zapped, sats flow, community grows, and my episodes of THE Bitcoin Podcast get more visibility. #GrowNostr ?\n6. Thanks to Zap Splits, I can add my podcast guests to a split list, ensuring that any zaps I received are also shared with them (which I did for HODL and Cason on this long-form note).\n\nAnyway, that's enough chit chat for now. Let's see if this works or if it's just a late-night idea that doesn't seem as smart in the morning.\n\n**The full transcript of the episode is below, in addition to some of the quotes I pulled already (feel free to highlight the shit out of them).

And maybe these Bitcoin guys who have made some money and some self-independence for themselves, maybe they have a point.’ But instead they go, this is a far right Psyop that's being played in order to try to destroy the wonderfulness of modern monetary theory. And the government needs to be able to print out money because how else can we spread the love and make sure that all people everywhere are always equal and have all of the equal opportunity always, particularly the brown people that we want to bomb out of existence because, you know, they need to use my fucking pronouns. And that's why we're bombing the shit out of them is because they're hateful, racist pieces of garbage that, you know, and then, and then there's just like the like, well, like fuck Israel, we can't like support them. But like Ukraine is great. Or the people doing the opposite one. I'm like, what, like, why the fuck is the red or the blue people telling you to bomb the right people?\n\n**HODL (50:34.642)**\nYou can just do things. You don't have to wait for anybody. Nothing's decreed. Like, listen, fiat is a fucking disease of the mind. That's what it is. And every currency on earth that's not Bitcoin is fiat. Ethereum is fiat. Solana is fiat. Tether is fiat. They're all fiat, okay? And then obviously all the fiat currencies are fiat. But fiat is not just affecting the monetary supply and material goods like iPhones and shit. No, fiat affects YOU. It affects your mind. It affects the way you think. You think that the world is decreed to you from scribes on high. It's not. The world is built by people that get out and build the fucking world. So if you want to do something, just go do it. Get politically active if you want to be politically active. Build a business if you want to build a business. Build a family if you want to build a family. Build an estate if you want to build an estate. Go to Mars if you want to go to Mars. Fucking just go do it. Do what you want to do. That is the Bitcoin story. Not by decree. No one tells you to do it. You decree it. You fucking decree it. You go out and do what the fuck you're gonna do in the world. That's what we're doing here in Bitcoin.\n\n**HODL**\n“The state condemned a man to slow death, double life imprisonment. And we said, ‘no, you don't get to do that.’ We got to rewrite the rules of the game as the game was being played. And it shows that we don't have to just sit there and take it.”\n\n**Erik Cason (01:01:49.037)**\nthe world fucking needs Americanism right now. Like shit is fucked up and there needs to be a renewal of this American spirit that pushes out into the world that, you know, is what 1776 was about, which was a global revolution that then swept through Europe because they're like, yo Europeans, look, we just like fucked up the British empire and we earned our own rights by fighting these assholes. Would you like that? They're like, yeah, this like monarchy shit is bullshit. Let's, let's fucking fight. And I hope that we're going to see a renewal of that same spirit that we're going to fight back against our federal government and their surveillance in the deep state and that we're going to push that shit out numb into Europe and that the Europeans are going to be like, yeah, you know what? turns out getting asked fucked by our government and getting global surveillance through a CBDC is bullshit. Let's fight these motherfuckers.\n\n**HODL**\nThat is the Bitcoin story. Not by decree. No one tells you to do it. You decree it. You fucking decree it. You go out and do what the fuck you're gonna do in the world. That's what we're doing here in Bitcoin.\n\n\n## TRANSCRIPT: AMERICAN HODL x ERIK CASON\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (00:00.07)\nground audio, but the new Macs do it like really fucking well shockingly, which is honestly quite nice. Okay. We are allegedly live on zap.stream. So I'm just going to fiddle with this for a second. Let's see here. But yeah, we were, Eric, we were just discussing that hodl is basically on team no sleep right now. and has been, yeah, just\n\nHODL (00:01.4)\nMm-hmm.\n\nErik Cason (00:07.304)\nIt's just.\n\nErik Cason (00:11.184)\nAlright.\n\nHODL (00:24.418)\nWell, ever since they stole the 2020 election, you gotta stay up all night now.\n\nErik Cason (00:24.72)\nAre you?\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (00:29.668)\nIt's true. You got to keep them in check.\n\nErik Cason (00:32.525)\nSo is this like a young children thing or is this like your brain is all spun out from\n\nHODL (00:38.808)\nNo, this is was it. No, it's because I was at Bitcoin mags live stream for like 12 hours yesterday and I didn't get home until like, you know, 1 30 a.m. and then I fucking didn't go to sleep until 2 a.m. And then because I have young children, I was up at 5 a.m. So it's like, you know, good times.\n\nErik Cason (00:54.893)\nGood. No, I... My sleep got absolutely fucked a couple nights ago, because like I was like, I'm gonna stay up a little late and watch a movie. And then my brain was like, yeah, you want to stay up fucking late, asshole? How about you fall asleep at 4 a.m.? So this last night I was like, you know what? Like this shit isn't worth it anymore. Like I'm a fucking adult. I'm going to bed at nine o'clock. I'm going to get up at six o'clock and like work out and do all my like adult shit because...\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:07.735)\nhow you like that.\n\nErik Cason (01:18.866)\nI'm just like fucking sick. Like I could do that shit when I was in my 20s, but like that's a long ways away from now. So now I gotta like take care of my body or it's gonna fuck me up.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:30.62)\nit's I was out. I was fishing like this whole weekend, like a dude's trip with my, dad and my father-in-law and like some other older dudes. And just like, yeah, we were fishing, fishing for steelheads. It was a wonderful time. My first time fishing for steelheads had a fucking blast, but like you're out in the river all goddamn day. And by the time we got back, like, and I was like the young buck of the group and still I'm like, 7 P.M. It's about time to turn in like, fuck.\n\nErik Cason (01:42.099)\nDrop.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (02:00.591)\nBut yeah, so I feel your pain. But then last night I got home from the trip and like was watching MSNBC for fun and stayed up until like three or something because I was.\n\nHODL (02:08.802)\nYeah. did either of you watch the view this morning? It was, it was so good. I would highly recommend it. Well, they start whoopee Goldberg starts off with tears in her eyes and she's trying to be magnanimous and she, she goes, yeah, let's talk about, let's get into it. And then she passes it to Joy Behar and Joy Behar holds it together for like,\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (02:13.572)\nNo.\n\nErik Cason (02:13.819)\nNo, like-\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (02:19.915)\nDescribe it.\n\nHODL (02:35.832)\n90 % of the time and she's like, you know, we got it. It was a fair election and we got it just but he's a racist and then they just like rescinded. It's a full struggle session. It was amazing. Like honestly, it could have been pay-per-view. I would have paid $75 to watch it. It was one of the greatest things I've ever seen. It was amazing.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (02:47.081)\nmy god.\n\nErik Cason (02:56.683)\nSo like, what are they gonna do now other than just like malfunction and have a hard time? Like I'm just really enjoying getting to like sit in this space and being like democracy is super great, isn't it? Isn't it wonderful that we elected a fascist Hitler who's waited for his second term to implement the genocide against all of the people that are you? And they're like, the demogood, so I'm really.\n\nHODL (03:20.024)\nYeah.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (03:24.54)\nThe glitching is real right now. you almost feel bad, or I would almost feel bad, if the people who are glitching, like, were glitching right now, weren't so insufferable for so long. Like, I would almost feel bad, you know what I mean? But I'm not quite there yet.\n\nHODL (03:40.049)\nYeah, yeah. No, I don't feel a shred of guilt about anything. I'm just laughing at all the memes. It's hilarious.\n\nErik Cason (03:42.172)\nOne.\n\nErik Cason (03:47.146)\nLike look, like fuck this voting and democracy nonsense, but like I'm, really enjoying these liberals that have used the last four years to try to cram all this fucking nonsense down everybody's throat and now have to deal with like the reactionary against that. in addition to the fact of that, like it's about fucking time. Like the last, the last four years were like really fucking wacky. And like we had, we, we still have this geriatric prison. Like what the fuck happened to Joe Biden? Did he just like vanish? Like what?\n\nHODL (04:08.6)\nMm-hmm.\n\nErik Cason (04:16.862)\nIt's just so weird to me in that, like in the meanwhile, the whole liberal machine keeps marching on being like, like this is, so anyways, I'm just excited to watch this whole thing kind of break down and crash into flames and see what happens.\n\nHODL (04:31.128)\nI woke up feeling just proud of America. And the reason I was proud of America is not because America voted the way I wanted them to vote, which they did, like in a landslide victory. The reason I was proud of them, proud of the feeling of being American was that propaganda doesn't work on us. You tried to Psyop us and we just aren't fucking having it.\n\nBecause being an American means doing whatever the fuck we want and you are not allowed to tell us what to do. That's the feeling, that's the energy I woke up with. Like, the American people are exactly who I thought they were. You know, it's like that meme. They are who we thought they were! They are who we thought they were! You know, it's like, the American people are who I thought they were and they're just as fucking wild and untamed and fucking crazy.\n\nand individualistic as I've always expected and needed them and wanted them to be and known that they were and I just fucking love it. I love seeing the results come in and then the people who are the professional propagandists, the Joe Scarborough, the MSNBCs, the Rachel Maddows, the Whoopi Goldbergs, right? Professional paid propagandists go, I can't believe calling them racist garbage didn't work. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck all of you. Fuck you.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (05:51.245)\nIt's fucking insane.\n\nErik Cason (05:51.287)\nWell, it's interesting because like it's a it's this really reactionary hateful thing where and it's like super hypocritical where it's like, fuck you, you racist piece of goddamn shit. Like you need to go into the fucking concentration camp and be brutally raped and tortured because you won't tolerate other people. You fucking sick fucking pig. And it's like, you know, maybe there should be some self reflection here about some of those things you said and are expressing and like\n\nHODL (06:20.642)\nYeah.\n\nErik Cason (06:20.715)\nI don't know, like this is the thing that I've been trying to deal with kind of in the liberal bubble I'm in. It's like, hey, do you guys think that like all the hatred and vitriol that you're directing at white people and about like how useless men are and that they really obstruct everything that could have ever been done that's good might have a little something to do with this. In addition to like, perhaps we're in the position that we're in because of the way that you keep shitting on all these people that actually\n\nmight have some degree of value to society. And I'm not saying they're better or worse than anybody, but maybe trying to direct all your hate towards them could have something to do with the outcome that came here as opposed to you being like, hey, these people, we'd like to include them in the fold rather than just kind of doing the reverse hate thing. But you know, I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a politician.\n\nHODL (07:07.96)\nYeah.\n\nIt's tough to tell people like, you know all that shit that's in your head? That's not real. It's just not real. None of it. You made it up. You're living in magical fairy princess land. Okay. And what I would, what I would want you to do is form a hypothesis and test it. You know I mean? Like experiment. Are you in magical fairy princess land? Can you fly? You know what I mean? Maybe you start on the ground first. Don't jump out of a window, but like, you know, maybe test your flap your wings little, see if it works.\n\nIf it doesn't, maybe we have the wrong hypothesis. I don't know. Weird. Just be calling here.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (07:42.586)\nWhoa, that would require like critical thought though and actual self-reflection and like now they've just like they've gone the other way and they're like well actually the black and Latinos are racist too and they clearly like and you're like hold on hold on guys I was told because of the intersectional hierarchy that they couldn't be Racist but but now they are racist and the Arabs to some of those Arabs We don't like them the Cubans especially escaping communism coming here voting for a Republican. Who do they think they are? It's ridiculous\n\nHODL (07:53.748)\nRight.\n\nHODL (08:00.876)\nThey can't be racist. Yeah, they can't.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (08:12.804)\nYeah, it's fucking will there be any self-reflection though like any like moment of inward like looking inward to say Maybe we were kind of part of the problem, huh? Hmm\n\nHODL (08:23.448)\nThey're nowhere close to being ready to deal with reality. In a sense, kind of like, it's a huge miscarriage of American civil duty that's happened because these people have been so badly brainwashed and Psy-op by the mainstream media, these professional state propagandists that you can't help but feel a little bit bad for them. at the same time, mean,\n\nThere's nothing to do but to get out of your echo bubble. you, the only person who can crawl out of Plato's cave is you. And I don't know how to explain to you that the shadows aren't real. They're just not real. And so like those of us who are out of the cave, we, we all talk about how retarded you all are in the cave, but we don't know how to actually get you out of the cave. Cause every time we try and bring you out, you fucking bite us and go rabid, you know?\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (09:17.66)\nAnd we can literally tell you the cave exit is right there. This is where you need to go to get out of the cave. And they're like, that exit looks not really like it's inclusive. I don't think I'm going to go out that way. Sorry, Kason. Go ahead,\n\nErik Cason (09:17.689)\nIt's a pretty sad situation overall.\n\nErik Cason (09:31.29)\nWell, like with it being at a Bitcoin all time high right now, like that, you know, is what I came on with is that like, look, you dumb motherfuckers, like you could have, you could have just doubled your fucking wealth over, know, over the last year, had you just like shut the fuck up and been like, maybe I'm poor and working at a dead end job that I fucking hate because I don't understand how money actually works. And maybe these Bitcoin guys who have like made some money and some\n\nself-independence for themselves, like maybe they have a point. But instead they go, this is a far right Psyop that's being played in order to try to destroy the wonderfulness of modern monetary theory. And the government needs to be able to print out money because how else can we spread the love and make sure that all people everywhere are always equal and have all of the equal opportunity always, particularly the brown people that we want to bomb out of existence because\n\nYou know, they need to use my fucking pronouns. And that's why we're bombing the shit out of them is because they're hateful, racist pieces of garbage that, you know, and then, and then there's just like the like, well, like fuck Israel, we can't like support them. But like Ukraine is great. Or the people doing the opposite one. I'm like, what, like, why the fuck is the red or the blue people telling you to bomb the right people? Regardless, like maybe you should just be upset that brown people are\n\nyou know, and in the case of Ukraine, white people too are getting blown up. Like the bombs are not racist. They will kill people whether they're white or brown. And I don't know, it would just be really great if people could be like, you know, maybe we should just kind of talk to people instead of murder them. But again, I'm not a politician. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. Maybe they need to be murdered.\n\nHODL (11:07.501)\nYeah.\n\nkey on this is like the Bitcoin price as a lens by which to view the world. It's like last night when I was watching the election results. I was at Bitcoin Magazine studio and they had all the boards up and all the stuff, you know, and I'm watching it all. It's like the traditional media and I'm on my phone looking at the Bitcoin price and I'm like Trump's gonna win. Like it just got bid in the markets. This is gonna happen. I now know the future ahead of traditional media.\n\nAnd it's the same thing with like, Polymarket was telling us Trump was going to win for months and months because people have been actually, you know, putting economic value behind those, those, you know, those votes that they're making with their economic capital, right? And so, you know, if you're listening to traditional media, you're trying to do sense making that way and you have like, you know, the, poll, the Nate Silvers of the world, the pollsters telling you, Ann Seltzer telling you like, he's going to win Iowa, whatever. they, these people have no skin in the game. So there's no.\n\nproof of work to their predictions. you need to, once you have proof of work as a lens, you as a Bitcoiner, look for it and see it and find it everywhere and anything that you can attach proof of work to, you realize that this is a real thing and you can bank on it. But I mean, people that don't have that are doing everything proof of stake, right? Like they just don't understand that reality that unfortunately they are living in. There's nothing you can do about it. can't.\n\nYou can't escape that reality, right? Like you are inside that reality.\n\nErik Cason (12:42.853)\nWell, it'd be clear like, proof of stake as a methodology that's like operable and like that's called socialism. Like I can actually like hijack the government and be like, Hey, Mr. Musk, like, fuck you. We're going to like steal all your shit. It's like, cool. Like now that we did that guys, like how much more runway we have? They're like, we have, we have four days. We got, we got four days to run the budget now. It's like, it's like the guy that's\n\nWait, wait, the guy that's getting us into space and like gave us like satellite internet and shit, like stealing everything from him got us four days of runway? And they're like, yeah. So we're out of time now. So who are we going to rob next? They're like, that Amazon guy. Yeah, like fuck him. He's like stealing from people and he's hateful. It's like, yeah. Why do you think he has better approval ratings than like the\n\nand like everyone in like the US military. Like it seems like people really like him. They're like, cause, cause he's, he's racist, right? So let's steal his shit. And like, and like, that's what proof of stake is about. It's like, fuck these other people. We can like steal their shit and like remake the rules so that like stealing shit is okay when we steal shit for the right reasons.\n\nAnd this is like the clusterfuck that's Ethereum. Like if you've watched like what their monetary policy has been like since the fucking Dow fork that happened, it's literally always been like, yeah, but like this is the one time it will ever happen. Well, maybe we'll change it again. You know what? Fuck it. We're just going to kind of do whatever we want. And like, that's fine, but it's not going to work out long-term and there's going to be very severe fucking consequences. So you...\n\ncould learn about how economics works and it turns out that like, nobody likes being stolen from and it turns out like, if I can steal from you, I can steal from other people too. And that's like a really big problem. So you should probably be invested in a system that goes, you know what? We're not gonna steal from anybody ever. But what about Hitler and Pol Pot? And it's like, yeah, it turns out that even fucking assholes, we like need to respect their right to property too.\n\nErik Cason (14:54.332)\nAnd they're like, but if we do that, then like all of the racist and hateful people will win. And it's like, you know, maybe you need to expand your worldview beyond thinking that everybody's hateful and racist. And that's kind of their main problem. By the way, like I've never actually, like when I was younger, I had a couple of friends, dads who were like pretty racist and stuff, but it was always this like, I don't know. Like I've never met somebody who like really had as their like main thing. They're like, yeah, but like, fuck the Mexicans and the black people. It's it's like usually like.\n\nYeah, but what about Habib? Like he was helping us out early and they're like, well, yeah, he's brown and that's fine. But, I'm like, so you're like, not really that racist. And they're like, well, you know, they're trying to take our jobs. And it's like, well, but were you gonna, were you gonna do the gardening? And they're like, well, no, fuck no. I ain't gonna get wet today. It's like, maybe he, maybe Jesus is pretty good at what he does, you know? I'm just saying.\n\nI don't think he's taking your job. You don't seem like you're gonna be gardening in the ring. I'm just saying.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (15:57.544)\nI think so much this is like a it's it's it is a mirror right like What you see and everybody else tends to be more of a reflection of what you have going on in the inside? Than what is actually going on with them because you don't fucking know them you have no way of knowing what they're what their beliefs are whether or not they are a Giant bigot and a racist or whether they're just some man or woman trying to live their life Put food in the table for their kids and not get just absolutely bent over a barrel by the government\n\nwhich is like a reasonable thing. Like nobody really wants to be bent over a barrel by the government, right? But apparently if you push back against that too hard, you are given one of these labels. But then it's like you have kind of this proof of concept here that this is just a reflection of what is going on in a lot of these, you know, bigot callers minds. When you see them say things like, you know, I can't like why would all of these Latinos vote for their own deportation? It's like, do you think the only Latinos in the country?\n\nare here illegally? Like, is that what you think? That they're voting for their own deportation? Like, there's lots of Latinos here who came here legally, like a ton of them. And it turns out a lot of them were escaping the same sort of bullshit socialist verging on communist policies that you're trying to push on them now. And then you turn around and call them racist because they didn't agree with you. Like, it's this insane\n\npaternalistic projection and I like but again the sad thing is I don't know if there is ever like a come to Jesus moment where they're like you know what you know guys we went too far we were wrong I was was pretty messed up for a few years there huh we're cool now let's keep things civil we're not gonna call everybody Nazis anymore especially you white lib or you white women you know you white suburban women you Nazis like it's just like turns out calling everybody a Nazi is a really bad campaign move like\n\nI don't know who like how who could have known right shocking.\n\nHODL (17:57.56)\nI think you guys are both being charitable and trying to diagnose them. I spent a lot of time trying to do that too, get into their heads and understand their psychology. How could you think this way? It's so severely retarded. And now I'm just like, listen, we have now unfettered control of all three branches of government. it's like, I don't listen. At the Thanksgiving dinner table, I don't pay attention to the conversation at the kids table. I don't care what the kids are talking about. You know what mean? It doesn't matter. It's like...\n\nWhat color crayon do you like? I don't know. like burnt umber. That's my favorite. Yeah. It's like no, who gives a fuck? We're at the adult table now and it's about stacking wins on the board and you know, like for instance, mean, Trump is the first Bitcoin president. Vance owns Bitcoin. We now have the opportunity to like see real Bitcoin appointments be made where like people who are being recommended for high purchase of power\n\nwill be people that are sympathetic to Bitcoin, if not Bitcoiners themselves from an ideological standpoint. And to me, that's the most fascinating thing that's going on. And whatever like woke mind virus is like eating the brains of like the liberal white women we all know. I don't give a single fuck like drink your Chardonnay bitch and like hopefully it cures it. I don't know what to tell you, you know, take some ivermectin.\n\nErik Cason (19:11.977)\nWell, it's funny because I have a good friend who like, you know, he's like, deep barrier roots. So like everybody is like very, very liberal. And like he's a bit of the black sheep of family. So he, you know, he was like, I'm going to vote for Trump. And this, this is like very upsetting to his family. And like, you know, everyone was getting outraged with him. And he was like, look, he was like, look, like the only way we get to talk about politics now is like, you have to steel man my position. Like you don't get to come to me and be like,\n\nBut Trump's like a racist bigot. Like you need to actually come to me and be like, well, perhaps you want to elect Trump because like you feel different about economic policies or whatever. And I've found like, this is the best way to actually like force people to, like think in a meaningful way. Cause like, otherwise they'll do the same bullshit with you. But I've found like it really glitches people pretty hard. Cause I can be like, look, like I, I understand your position. Like you think Kamala as being the first black woman president.\n\nis really going to create policies that champion and allow for, you know, people of various and diverse backgrounds to be able to have a real leg up in America. Totally hear that. I have a fundamentally different position that I don't believe that that actually helps people in a unique way. And I actually think there's a very discreet kind of racism that's going on with that. When you say, Hey, we need to give reparations to black people.\n\nbecause they're not good enough to be able to compete with the white people. It's like, they're, you know, like I see something a bit racist in that. And like, again, I'm not trying to take away from that. There, there can be good reasoning behind that, but you know, particularly living in the state of California where this has actually been proposed as like a meaningful bill seems pretty fucking racist to me to steal a bunch of money from me and give it to a bunch of, of, you know, people, you know, I think in this case, just black people that are going to be getting that.\n\nmoney directly when as far as I know they directly were not enslaved by me or my ancestors and I'm not sure what their relationship is to it either. I'm saying the with Kamala Harris like black woman this is this you know great that if she was elected that she would be the first black woman but let's be very clear she's not like African-American she's a Jamaican woman that's where she's descended from and again like doesn't take away from the fact that that is would be the first black woman president but\n\nErik Cason (21:35.851)\nShe is not an African-American and that's a bit misleading to kind of do that whole pitch. But most people are really uninterested in this just because they have a deep vested interest in what their emotional capacity is. And that's one of the things I've found deeply disturbing about a lot of liberal ideology is that like if something feels right, that means that like that is right. And when you try to pick that apart, they go, well, that's racist. And that doesn't feel like if I'm, that doesn't feel good. So we can't be that.\n\nAnd like it turns out that like maybe there's a little bit of racism you have going on there with, you know, wanting to steal money from white people and give it to all the other people. Just saying.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (22:16.397)\nIt's you know, it's you mentioned like this friend who's bucking the trend in his Bay Area family, right? And something I just think is so genuinely sad is that we are at a place right now and and I'm sure you know people could come up with examples of like well in the Civil War families were broken up over that and it's like, okay, let's not please let's not compare the two the two moments in time, but the fact that people will literally stop speaking to their family basically, you know, diso you know disavow them like well my\n\nMy mom voted for Donald Trump. And so I can't I just I won't speak to her anymore. I can't possibly because it turns out even though this woman loved me and raised me my entire life and made so many sacrifices for me and did everything she possibly could to give me every advantage I could have. She's a racist bigot. And it's like people will literally stop like I'm sure you guys know people like I can think of a number of people within circles. I run it like off the top of my head that level like nope.\n\nI won't be talking to them anymore. Like I like I'm out, you know, no more family Thanksgiving for me. I can't be around this racism. No more Christmas. I you're not going to see your grandchild. I don't know any of those examples personally out of no more grandchildren time. That'd be like especially fucked up. But the point is like how do you have so much hate in your heart that you cannot you cannot get over the fact that somebody that you love and that loves you may have a slightly different opinion than you.\n\nAnd that the fact that their opinion is different is so offensive to you that you would break apart those ties that bind you for a fucking political candidate, for a fucking agent of the state apparatus. That is fucking insane. Like that truly blows my mind and I think that is really sad. If somebody by some chances listened to this who's like, well I haven't talked to my uncle Jim in two years because he voted for so-and-so on either side of the fucking aisle. Who cares?\n\nLike you should be able to argue the most with the people you love the most. Because no matter what, at the end of the day, you guys fucking still love each other. Get the fuck over it. You're going to have disagreements. It's OK. That's a beautiful thing. And you should have people that challenge you.\n\nErik Cason (24:25.621)\nWhat?\n\nIt's both about like a first of all, it's about like a really weak frame of individual reference that that that's very frankly, callow at the bottom. Because like if you you have to identify so strongly with a political party or a movement that that becomes definitive about you and that like you you need to break with other people because they're disagreeing with it. Because like, look, like I'm clearly like a freak Bitcoiner and like everyone in my life doesn't agree.\n\nwith the Bitcoin thing, despite the fact that they've seen me have very, very fat gains while they have lost lots of money. And I think that's sad and unfortunate. And like, I'm always like waiting, you know, at the dinner table at Thanksgiving for them to be like, so Eric, like Bitcoin's at an all time high. Like we were all totally fucking wrong and we could have, you know, doubled our portfolios had we actually listened to you. But like, nope, never fucking happens. And at best I try to bring up the Bitcoin thing.\n\nWow, like the, just don't understand this money thing. So how was the game last night? And I'm like, you you could like, you could have actually like rolled that into like a question being like, so Eric, like what is money? Like why is Bitcoin actually different from the dollar? Cause I don't understand and you seem to get it. But yeah, that never happens. And I find it pretty sad and unfortunate. And like the other one is like.\n\nI'm still open to Bitcoin being fucking wrong. I'm certain it's not. I mean, like if you happen to be a top tier world cryptographer and you're like, check it out. There's this error in the sub 256 curve that was chosen. And turns out the whole thing's fucking broken. You know, I'd probably contact the US military first and like let them know and understand that fucking encryption standards don't work. I just find it pretty fascinating how deep.\n\nErik Cason (26:19.241)\nMost people have fled into the them and like they don't actually have a definitive idea of who and what they are, their purpose in the world. that they're like much more interested in making sure everybody feels comfortable and safe rather than making a little bit of discomfort in a conversation that might force some thought and growth. Cause like, again, I don't want to be a fucking asshole, but\n\nWhy don't we think real hard about how things are going and what we would really desire for ourselves and others? And like, I don't know. It's, I know this Thanksgiving is going to get interesting with people being like, that hateful bigot Trump, he was elected and he's going to destroy America now. I'll be like, yeah, like it was pretty bad when Hitler was elected for the second non-consecutive term. And when he really made the choice to go after all of his political opponents at that point in time, that was a really weird.\n\ntime in history, huh guys? And they're like, yeah.\n\nHODL (27:13.932)\nYeah, remember, remember Hitler's bipartisan coalition, you know, like the Tulsi Gavrids of the Weimar Germany were joining up with Hitler like, no, it's so stupid, dude. I think if we take it at face value, everything Eric said is and Walker said is true. But like, you know, I think a lot of these things are just that family members just really don't fuck with each other for deep, deep familial reasons like trauma, trauma reasons. And they're using the\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (27:24.998)\nyou\n\nHODL (27:40.93)\nthe Trump thing is a convenient excuse, right? Rather than going to therapy and like hashing out their shit or having a frank and honest conversation. I mean, I have family members in my life who, you know, I've had these frictions with and the truth is like, our relationship was never good. It goes deep to the psyche of both individuals in the conflict. It relates back to our grandparents and their site and you know, it just goes back and back and you're like.\n\nOkay, so I actually I've been like cast in a play here of like some deep familial trauma and I'm not even like really aware of what's going on and neither is the other participant. We just know that we don't like each other and then you have this flashpoint of Donald Trump's election in 2016 or in 2024 or whatever and then that becomes the the way to fissure like it creates the fissures in the relationship and whatever. So I think I think that's a lot of what's going on. But I also think that you know more on the\n\nthe topic that you were saying about, you were trying to talk to all these people and they wouldn't listen or whatever. I went through this myself and what I realized is that I had survivor's guilt. So I needed to fix them for me, had nothing to do with them. It was all about me. It had to do with my own feelings of inadequacy around not being able to save my own mother from her psychological issues. And then when I realized that I was like, okay, I can just stop doing that.\n\nbecause it's not serving the other person. I thought it was my way into being a good person. Like I'm a good person. I care about these people. I really want to help them and whatever. But the truth is man that there are people with a growth mindset and there are people without a growth mindset. And I'm a person with a growth mindset. I want to continue growing in life and doing, you know, cause there's no, there's no stasis in nature, right? That's nature abhors a vacuum. Like there is no stasis.\n\neverything's in constant flux. It's constant chaos and you're, basically either growing or decaying, right? That's how nature works. And so we are a part of nature. That's how we work. Also, that's how we work psychologically, but for some reason, people don't think or believe this and they like to, you know, have this sort of delusion that they're, they're a static element in a static system. makes no sense to me. And I can't stand people who are like that and I don't want to be around them. So for me, after I realized the survivor's guilt thing, I was like, okay, yeah.\n\nHODL (29:58.432)\nI don't want to be around people that don't have a growth mindset. And so now I just am not. So if you don't have that, if you don't think that way, I'm just not around you, bro. I don't know what you got going on and I don't care. And I wish you well. I hope you get out of it, but fuck off.\n\nErik Cason (30:13.977)\nYeah, I've, you know, it's taken me a while to learn it, but particularly family, it's as much as like, really want like deep connecting conversation and for like us to understand each other and for them to like meet me where I'm at. They have like zero fucking interest in that. Like they really want to talk about the weather, like anything that's like level one, maybe level two, but like level three, fuck no.\n\nand it took me a long time to like button up against that wall being like, what, like, why aren't you guys turned on? Like, why don't you like, you know, I'm like, like COVID was like a great example of like trying to bring that stuff up and like lots of big conflict coming up. And it hurt me for a long time because I was like, why don't they want to understand me? Like, this is so difficult. I want to be loved in the way I want to be loved. And like, I finally just kind of got to the place of like, like this is their shit.\n\nHODL (30:50.104)\nMm-hmm.\n\nErik Cason (31:04.262)\nthey're incapable of it. And like the more I rock the boat, the more that they're going to resist it, making capsize more likely. And like, I just need to be okay with doing the level one and level two thing with them. And the truth is I can, I can do level eight, nine, 10 shit with you guys. And like that's frankly, like that's why I really fucking love the Bitcoin community is cause like I can have real and sincere conversation where we actually think hard about shit and go deep and enjoy that. And like that's.\n\nKind of what friends are supposed to be for. Family can be for, you know, just loving them for who they're meant. you know, I love my mom, really great person. I'm never going to have a deep and thoughtful connecting conversation about the political nature of world and our reality with her. Gonna have a really great conversation about how beautiful the sky is. But, you know, that's about as far as it can go. And that's okay.\n\nAnd so I just, I really welcome people who are going to go into this Thanksgiving ready to fist fight everybody. Just like eat like a fucking marijuana brownie before that. And just like enjoy staring at the vase or some shit. Like it's not worth fighting your family and their stupid ideas of what they believe is right. Cause the other is like, if you're a Bitcoiner, like it's pretty clear that the next cycle is getting pumping right now.\n\nAnd so anybody who is even remotely smart in your family is going to come to you when Bitcoin's at $120,000 at Thanksgiving and be like, hey, you know, you like made like some money with this, right? And you can be like, yeah, I'm like really fucking high, but yeah, I made some money with this. And they'll be like, could you, could you tell me a bit about that? And maybe that'll be your opening. Don't, don't expect it, but\n\nYeah, I'm pretty sure that with what the Trump team is up to, they're about to like front run destroying the entire financial system. Cause that's like, that's kind of their MO. They're like good with this money shit and they all clearly hold Bitcoin and they're clearly going to be appointing people. So, look, like I'm not telling you what to do, but like, if you like money, you should probably buy Bitcoin and keep holding it for awhile. Cause I'm pretty sure it's going to keep going up for awhile here.\n\nErik Cason (33:15.035)\nAlthough there is some fucking moron right now who's absolutely gonna slam their hand in the door and be like, it's going back to 15k. No way the bit going to keep up with this.\n\nHODL (33:23.881)\n58K is a lost universe. Otto said it's not static. Bullshit. 58K, stable coin, static, static system.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (33:31.261)\nTo fair, I love the 58k meme and I am guilty of using it so much, but now I've also implemented the 158k meme because it looks almost the same to the the unseeing eye. You just see 58k, but there's a one in there.\n\nHODL (33:43.128)\nWhy not, why not 250 AK? Why not 350 AK? Why not 950 AK? Why not 1.258 K?\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (33:48.17)\nJesus I hadn't even gotten that far fuck why not\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (33:55.421)\n5.8 you know, like fuck it. Let's let's roll it up. So first of all, I appreciate you guys because you and I appreciate that we can have level eight and nine conversation, maybe someday a level 10. I don't know how high these levels go. So like how the scale works exactly, but I appreciate that there exist people that we can have these kinds of fucking talks with because it's you're right. It's not always within the family. Sometimes it is. And that's very fortunate, but like\n\nIf that's not you out there listening like that's okay, too Like you know, that's why that's why you're in Bitcoin, right? Because you can go meet with a bunch of other strange people who want to talk about how fucked up our monetary system is like ad nauseum and like are Super fucking down with that and that's a beautiful thing But I'm curious cuz cuz Eric you mentioned just like the Trump team MO being Go in and kind of like fuck shit up a little bit in the in the financial system. Do you think?\n\nDo you think, okay, like Trump is on board with that? Like, is Trump gonna go full on end the Fed? Like, is Ron Paul coming on here and we are fucking burning this thing down? Or is Trump, like, he's, I don't know about your, like, the vibes you've gotten from, but he seems more measured lately. Like, maybe it's, you know, almost getting assassinated. Maybe it's just a little, you know, couple extra years. Maybe it's Barron being nine and a half feet tall standing next to him. And he's like, you know what? I'm not the biggest guy in the room anymore. I don't know. We're like,\n\nWhere do you think we go? Where is Trump at on this? And do you think the team he's assembling is actually going to go in there and be like, no, we're going to bring the Fed down?\n\nErik Cason (35:34.077)\nI think from the standpoint, it looks like that's a possibility, but like I, I am very, very deeply convinced that like, the deep state is absolutely and unequivocally in control. And there's no conceivable fucking way that anybody in any elected or any appointed position can like meaningfully stop any of this. Cause like, I, I can't really imagine the powers that be in the back room are like, you guys, they let, like got the right people in the right position to like do stuff like.\n\nWhat are we gonna do now? And they're like, dang, guess we lost. We just gotta accept it. So no, and I think Ron Paul and Elon Musk and all the people who get in right position, they are absolutely going to try their best to do stuff. And then I'm pretty sure none of it's gonna happen. Same thing, totally holding my breath that Trump keeps his word about freeing Ross day one. Gonna be mum on the word until then. If it doesn't happen, I'm not gonna be shocked.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (36:28.371)\nYeah.\n\nErik Cason (36:32.094)\nIf it does happen, I will be the first to give alkylates to where they're due because that would be phenomenal. My hope is that everybody who's really full all the hopium of all this stuff will see the next two years play out. Very little will actually change in terms of it. Yeah, that's when I'm gonna launch my radical states rights movement to use the states to unilaterally fuck up the federal government.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (36:40.764)\nAmen.\n\nHODL (36:59.272)\nDude, let's talk about the Ross thing for a second because did anyone have more on the line yesterday than Ross Ulbricht? No. Like, mean, Ross Ulbricht's life hung in the balance. was double life, rot in a prison cell for all eternity until you die and are taken away in a casket or freedom in three months, freedom in two and a half months. I mean, that's a fucking crazy\n\ncrazy thing that he had to live through, you know, the potential that either one of these outcomes, was like, everyone was saying it was a 50-50 toss up between these outcomes. And luckily, we're in the good timeline. And, you know, I was hanging out with the production crew when I was at this thing last night, and, you know, basically they were asking me like, why do you guys all care so much about Ross? And I said, listen, Ross's story is a miscarriage of justice.\n\nand Ross didn't deserve double life. did do something wrong. He did deserve some prison time. Like, that's just how it is. I know, like, the anarcho-capitalist would be like, no way, bro, but it's like, come on. I mean, we have a society that has rules. He broke the rules. Like, he does a little time. But he's, at this point in life, he has paid his, whatever debt he owed to society has been more than paid. He just created a website. He never hired hitmen. All that is bullshit. The man who allegedly,\n\nhe hired to have killed supports him as a vocal supporter of Ross Ulberg. I mean, you've been lied to about this case, the agents, the federal agents on the case were dirty. They were they were stealing. Yes. Yeah, FBI. Yep.\n\nErik Cason (38:33.375)\nLike all of them from different agencies, like every single motherfucking federal agent in that goddamn agency stole money, like it's fucking insane. And most of them like got off the hook too. And this is what I'm so fucking angry about is the hypocrisy of\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (38:34.759)\nYeah.\n\nHODL (38:43.352)\nYeah, they did last time that Ross last time that Ross exactly. No, and I mean what I'm saying is like this is this case is a miscarriage of justice and Ross deserves to be free and he will be free in two and a half months. I'm not one of these Bitcoiners who's like we'll see bro. We'll see if Trump does it like no, no, he's he's gonna be free. It's a campaign promise. We put up serious money and we went to bat for Trump and now we're gonna get Ross out and the reason it's important to us is what I told the production crew.\n\nis because yes, all those things are truths of miscarriage of justice, et cetera. But what it shows is that we are ascendant politically, that we matter, that we're important. Things weren't supposed to happen this way. And then they happen this way. The state condemned a man to slow death, double life imprisonment. And we said, no, you don't get to do that. We got to rewrite the rules of the game as the game was being played. And it shows that we don't have to just sit there and take it. mean, imagine the timeline where Bitcoin goes to zero.\n\nIn that timeline, Ross rots in prison for the rest of his life. But we're in the good timeline where Bitcoin is at 76k and Ross is free in two and a half months. And I mean, it just shows that we are going to be players in the world. You're not going to be off in the woods with your cold card shoved up your ass. I mean, if you want to do that, like that's fine. Like get freaky. It's okay. Bitcoin is about freedom, but\n\nErik Cason (40:03.294)\nYou should really consider a ledger if you're doing that, you know.\n\nHODL (40:05.41)\nGo like that, open your eyes. Yeah, don't, the cold card is very square. Listen, you want to shove it up your ass, you be my guest, okay? But we're going to be playing.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (40:05.901)\nYeah, for real.\n\nErik Cason (40:14.43)\nI really need to make a buttplug that is specifically designed for this.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (40:18.076)\nHow has no one made that yet? That's my question.\n\nHODL (40:19.544)\nI know right. We are going to be players in the world and we're going to have political power. And we're also going to make some butt plugs. Okay. That can accept a leg.\n\nErik Cason (40:25.255)\nseed taker.\n\nErik Cason (40:32.606)\nYou want your engraved butt plug? Please read each other.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (40:37.95)\nWe're thinking of spinning up a little, a little shop for them. They're going to be super nice. Hypoallergenic, course, really smooth on entry. Not so much on exit. Cause you don't want that thing coming out necessarily, right? Like you got to keep it in there.\n\nErik Cason (40:41.129)\nYou\n\nHODL (40:43.224)\nI'm\n\nHODL (40:51.938)\nJust to wrap that up, I'm happy for Ross and I'm happy for us. think like this is a big moment in Bitcoin's history. Ross being for it is a big moment.\n\nErik Cason (41:02.625)\nWell, and and, you know, I'm on the opposite side. I'm going to hold my breath till it happens. And when it does, I'm, you know, that'll bring you back in the fold from like crazy crypto anarchist land. Like I'm, might like move into like far right political activism or some shit. but it's really important to get that, like, we're an actual political force now. And like, I really hope that we're going to start behaving like it and that there's going to be like a real actual Bitcoin contingency because like,\n\nHODL (41:09.698)\nJust fair.\n\nErik Cason (41:30.175)\nI actually think in the next four years, there's a real fucking shot of ending the Fed. And like, I don't think anybody inside the federal government will do it, but I do legitimately believe that like, if we got 35 states to push through their state legislature legislation to like end the Fed, that that shit would get amended to the constitution. And like the federal government would have to like flip the fuck out and figure out how to do that.\n\nAnd I think it's really important because like the federal government is so out of fucking control at this point in time. We really need to start figuring out new and different methodologies to change how that can happen. So I'm just excited to see all the change that's happening and also like fucking 100K is like in play now. So it's to be really exciting when we get there. I haven't heard from Valis in like a year. Well, I've privately heard him from before, but like I hope his 100K party is still going to happen somewhere.\n\nHODL (42:12.6)\ndude, 100k by Thanksgiving.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (42:21.727)\nYeah, we're whether I mean I don't like to you know talk about price too much on this show because I'm not an open-mouthed YouTube shill But that being said caveat, you know, it is like above 70 say we're like 76 200 right now that's just like kind of a trip, you know, and I would I agree with you that like As I was watching the price last night again, I like I've been on the river these last like four days. I have like checked\n\nTwitter a couple of times then I was like, nah, that's not really of interest to me. Like I'm out in fucking nature catching fish hanging out with like my dad. Like that's what I want to, this is what I want to be doing right at this moment. And, then I got back and of course I was like, yes, you know, like bring it in. And then, you know, stayed up until 2 AM watching MSNBC as one does, but like you could, you could feel something was happening and I think you can feel something is happening now. And I just wonder like,\n\nHODL (43:00.93)\nYeah.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (43:17.916)\ndoes Bitcoin like because I would say that Bitcoin is it is inherently partisan or excuse me it is inherently political it is not partisan right it is like money is always going to be political we're talking about separating fucking money in state of course that is going to be political it is not inherently partisan it is only partisan if partisans make it partisan and that's not to say the people that are pro Bitcoin are the partisans who are making it partisan it's the ones on the other side who are reactionary to it right\n\nHODL (43:25.804)\nYes.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (43:46.343)\nSo I'm just interested to see like, I mean, fuck like there, it's a, it's a red fucking wave. Like Trump blew out the popular vote. He's got the mandate, right? He obviously won the electoral college. You've got a Republican majority in the house and the Senate by all rights. have no excuse not to do everything they claim they want to do. Right? Like they have, there's no excuse.\n\nHODL (44:04.704)\ninterest rate. 100%. By the way, by the way, the Democrats going after us and brought and broader crypto markets was such in retrospect, such a massive unforced error on their part. There was no reason to make significant enemies of us. None. And all they did was suffer because of it. Now, like, I don't know how much we affected the election.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (44:21.554)\nYes.\n\nHODL (44:32.62)\nBut we affected it some non-trivial amount, okay? And it just, it wasn't something they needed to do and they did it anyway because they were drunk with power. That's why they\n\nErik Cason (44:43.022)\nI mean, they did it because like they believe their own retarded bullshit that they like they had literally pumped up their own ass intentionally where they're they're like, this is used for terrorism financing and it's it's so all the bros can get away with tax and like it was all bullshit that they just repeatedly kept convincing themselves like like the fucking Greenpeace nonsense and like the like I feel so bad for the guy that's running that Twitter because like\n\nLike all he does is tweet something and is immediately, like provided all of the evidence of how fucking wrong he is. And like the other thing that's just so shameful is that like these people are supposed to actually like give a fuck about the environment and like, what's more important than making sure that we're actually getting clean hydro power from power plants that were going to be shut down otherwise, you know, like what's more important to people in sub-Saharan Africa who have never had access to\n\nfucking electricity and can't have clean water and now they can. Like it's, it's just so disingenuous. And like, again, I would really hope that, you know, the Democrats would sit down and be like, wow, we like, we really fucked that one up. We should really like reconsider this. But, I very, very strong doubts that that's going to happen. And it's going to be really interesting to see kind of what the co what comes out of it. But yeah, I have a very strong expectation.\n\nthat they are going to continue to double down until essentially they fracture the Democrat party into like, there's either gonna be a renewed moderated democratic movement or it's gonna fracture out into like different parties. Either way, it's gonna be fucking entertaining.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (46:26.386)\nCan I say something controversial guys? am, I am, I am glad Elizabeth Warren was reelected because honestly, I, she was, she was against what John Deaton, right? He was like the, yeah, he lost.\n\nErik Cason (46:28.546)\nNo.\n\nHODL (46:30.962)\nYeah.\n\nErik Cason (46:36.254)\nwas she?\n\nHODL (46:41.1)\nYeah, he lost. Yeah. He had an uphill battle. She's very well funded in her state and Massachusetts is a liberal shithole.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (46:46.202)\nshe is.\n\nErik Cason (46:47.973)\nHuh, where'd that money come from? That's really interesting. Huh.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (46:50.723)\nfrom but he was funded by crypto lobbyists. But no, the reason I'm happy that Elizabeth Warren won is because I would have missed her. I would have honestly missed reply guying her all the time when she says stupid fucking useless shit like that would have left a little bit of a hole in me. And I don't know how I would have filled it like I need something to butt up against. And like Pocahontas is the best.\n\nHODL (46:55.65)\nYeah.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (47:18.52)\nShe's just the best for that. it's like when she talks about price gouging, I see Elizabeth Warren price gouging tweet. And I'm just like, yes, I know what I'm doing today. You know, like, it's nice to have that. And like, I also think to your point, Eric, like, she is going to their and to your point as well, like unforced errors, she's going to continue to fracture the Democratic Party. Because like, like one in fucking seven Americans owns Bitcoin, like owns Bitcoin.\n\nThis is according to the study that Troy Cross did. There's probably a margin of error there. But even if it's one in fucking five Americans, that's already a shitload. And we are not even in like number go up mania yet where people are like, I probably need some of that. This is a growing coalition. And to fight against it is just like, first of all, you're fighting against freedom and you're just fighting against people from all walks of life. It's not like these are just the crypto bros or all these, you know, like not every, you know,\n\nBitcoin bro is as fucking radical as case in over here, you know, and I mean that in honestly the most complimentary way possible just so know, Eric, but like that, like what the fuck are they fighting against? What are they anti your anti freedom? Your anti people being able to make decisions for themselves. But it's like, like it's like my body, my choice, like my fucking money, my choice. Fuck right off. Anyway, I'm so glad I was so glad she was reelected. That's it. That's\n\nErik Cason (48:25.289)\nThank you, I appreciate that.\n\nHODL (48:38.968)\n100 % no, I was gonna I was gonna say the same thing you said which is that it's such a it's such a bipartisan like coalition multi racial like pluralistic like I mean Bitcoin is a large tent like the Orange Party is the largest tent we have politically and they did they made a large mistake going after us because you know, first of all, it's like\n\nErik Cason (48:44.359)\nback in a minute, gentlemen.\n\nHODL (49:06.604)\nAre you dumb? You're going after young millennials with money who are multi- like racially diverse? The fuck is- are you stupid? Like what's wrong? It doesn't even make sense. It doesn't even compute. But anyway, listen, there was a referendum on these people last night. I feel confident that this worldview is going to be dealt a hearty blow. And they're gonna realize that, you know, there's a new player in town and it's the crypto lobby and the Bitcoin lobby.\n\nAnd David Bailey in some non-trivial fashion was responsible for freeing Ross Ulbrich from prison or will be responsible for freeing Ross Ulbrich from prison and for getting Donald Trump elected. He made a significant, you know, mark dent on this election and he's the MVP of Bitcoin in 2024. Like that goes to David Bailey, number one with a bullet. There's no one else that even came close this year. And, you know, I think\n\nIt just reminds me, I was talking with David Zell about this last night that you can just do things. You can just do things. Whatever you want to do, you can just do it. Just do it. Elon wanted to affect the election. He just went out and rounded up a bunch of Amish people and drove them to the polls because the Amish can't drive themselves to the polls. He was like, we will drive you to the polls. You hate the government, right? And the Amish were like, fuck yeah. They tried to shut down our raw milk and shit. And Elon was like, yeah, fuck that.\n\nWe will drive you there. Let's all go vote. You can just do things. You don't have to wait for anybody. Nothing's decreed. Like, listen, fiat is a fucking disease of the mind. That's what it is. And every currency on earth that's not Bitcoin is fiat. Ethereum is fiat. Solana is fiat. Tether is fiat. They're all fiat, okay? And then obviously all the fiat currencies are fiat. But fiat is not just affecting the monetary supply and material goods like iPhones and shit. No, fiat affects\n\nYou. It affects your mind. It affects the way you think. You think that the world is decreed to you from scribes on high. It's not. The world is built by people that get out and build the fucking world. So if you want to do something, just go do it. Get politically active if you want to be politically active. Build a business if you want to build a business. Build a family if you want to build a family. Build an estate if you want to build an estate. Go to Mars if you want to go to Mars. Fucking just go do it. Do what you want to do.\n\nHODL (51:31.916)\nThat is the Bitcoin story. Not by decree. No one tells you to do it. You decree it. You fucking decree it. You go out and do what the fuck you're gonna do in the world. That's what we're doing here in Bitcoin.\n\nErik Cason (51:52.808)\nthe to elaborate on your point, like, this fucking disease has rotted out 95 % of all of the creative potential of people everywhere. And it's great to see that that 5 % is making the change for the other 90%. Like, what we're seeing being developed in this entire system is fucking phenomenal. And people are not asking for fucking permission anymore. And I really hope between what we're seeing in Bitcoin, and the renewal of this American spirit that like,\n\nLike one of the things I didn't realize last night with that I was so excited about when I started watching the Bitcoin price go up and the markets go up. was like, yeah, like there's this entire economic engine that's sighing with relief now that they're not going to get fucked out of existence by a socialist government that fucking hates them. And that maybe there's real potential to actually create dynamic change. Like I actually, and I think it's really interesting that people like this tariff thing's going to destroy anything. Like fuck that, this tariff thing's going to supercharge the fucking economy.\n\nLike it's gonna turn out that like people that are importing cheap shit from China and they have to pay twice as much, they're gonna go, you know, maybe I'm gonna buy the American made thing where I'm not gonna have to pay twice as much for the same thing, you know? And like that's a really great fucking thing. And I understand all the economic arguments about how tariffs work and otherwise, but like, let's be clear, cheap shit from China that's subsidized by slavery, like it's not good for fucking America. You know what's good for America? Shit made in America that paid American people.\n\nHODL (53:17.067)\nhuh.\n\nErik Cason (53:18.59)\nthat give American salaries so that they can spend money in America. And like, not to get on the nationalistist thing, but like, the other thing is, like, the world fucking needs Americanism right now. Like shit is fucked up and there needs to be a renewal of this American spirit that pushes out into the world that, you know, is what 1776 was about, which was a global revolution that then swept through Europe because they're like, yo Europeans, look, we just like fucked up the British empire and we...\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (53:30.43)\nYes.\n\nErik Cason (53:47.21)\nearned our own rights by fighting these assholes. Would you like that? They're like, yeah, this like monarchy shit is bullshit. Let's, let's fucking fight. And I hope that we're going to see a renewal of that same spirit that we're going to fight back against our federal government and their surveillance in the deep state and that we're going to push that shit out numb into Europe and that the Europeans are going to be like, yeah, you know what? turns out getting asked fucked by our government and getting global surveillance through a CBDC is bullshit. Let's fight these motherfuckers. And I would love to see more than anything.\n\nSee, a sincere German nationalist movement renew itself instead of them living in their fucking shame about Nazism and like, get that like that shit's over guys and that like Germans, you actually have some like really great shit about your culture that if you guys can protect in a meaningful way, very similar to Americans and still be able to be inclusive with that ideal, like there's something great to be done. But like living in all this shame about like, like.\n\nwe're bunch of racist Nazis because we believe German culture is great is the same kind of bullshit that they're trying to tell us about because you believe in America and what America means, it doesn't mean that you're a far right racist. It means that you're a fucking American that believes in the real values and ethics of what it means to be American. So, you know, fuck this fiat bullshit, fuck CBDCs and it's time for us to really start rebuilding in a meaningful and thoughtful way on top of a Bitcoin standard because that's really an American standard.\n\nHODL (55:00.344)\nMm-hmm.\n\nHODL (55:12.162)\nFuck yeah. Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. Fuck No. No. No. No.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (55:12.479)\nfucking it. Fuck. Yeah, Wait, can we talk about Europeans for a second? Because like, wait, wait, just for one second. Cause have you noticed that the only people more confused about what happened in the U S election than the Democrats are the Europeans. They're like, on. What do you, what do you mean? Don't you understand? He's mean and bad. And how sad is this? These Americans, how did like it's it's mind blowing. And then you're like, God,\n\nHODL (55:24.822)\nis the Europeans,\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (55:41.149)\nLike your point Eric like yeah, like I'm like so I feel like sometimes I went through the state like a stage in my life where I was like not I love America I love America because I love the fucking American idea and I love the American people and I love the possibilities that the existence of the American idea Allows for people in this country because it allows people to fucking create and build and do meaningful things but I went through a stage where I was like, you know, this is on my my Bitcoin journey where I'm also like\n\nWell, but the fucking military industrial fucking war machine, the fucking the fucking fiat monetary colonialism that's perpetuated by the IMF and the World Bank, like and the Federal Reserve. This is this is bad. Like and then I got to the point where naturally like five seconds later I was like, yeah, but that's not America. Like that's fucking institutions. That is US government institutions. Those are institutions of theft and destruction and death.\n\nAmerica is a fucking idea and it's the people who hold that idea up and use it as their fucking torch to bring light into darkness and That is what I think people can get behind and I think you should be able to fucking get behind that Like I don't give a fuck what political party you fucking identify with like this week or forever in your entire life like There I don't know if you guys have heard anybody say this before but there is no red. There is no blue There is the state and there is you\n\nYes, there are meaningful differences in political parties. Obviously, there's a difference between Kamala, like what Kamala's administration would have been and what Trump's will be. But ultimately, we are not a divided people. We are a people who are united around the idea that America is fucking amazing. That idea is fucking amazing. And we are going to be fucking damned if we will let the state usurp that idea for its own fucking death and destruction and theft. And I think\n\nI hope that more people can get around that and realize that look we're all on the fucking same side. There are two sides. It is the people the independent individuals and it is the state. There is no other side like there's no there's no other sides. You can color the horse a different color but like it's still the state granted again. me caveat. There are some differences especially you get down to local governments. There's a lot of difference but like we have so much more not to sound fucking cheesy.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (58:02.634)\nWe have so much more that brings us together than divides us. And what brings us together is the idea that America is fucking special. And if it wasn't for fucking America, Europe would be still have been fucked from those fucking German Nazis, actual Nazis. Like we have literally pulled Europe's own head out of its ass so many times. And yet they still look at us like, well, these, you know, uncouth barbarians. It's like, you know, fucking right. We're uncouth and we're fucking barbarians. And there's a reason that you called us.\n\nwhen you fucking got your panties in a twist and started murdering tr- like millions of people because you couldn't handle it on your fucking own, you pansies. Like, I love- for any Europeans listening, I fucking love you because you're listening to this and you obviously have a set of balls or maybe not balls, you know, you may be a lady European, but like, America is uniquely positioned to drive massive change in the world because of the American idea. That is what I would say.\n\nHODL (58:58.392)\nThe American, by the way, the thing that's beautiful about America, the American ideal, what is it, right? Like people might not know, especially if you're from Europe, the American ideal is I am the king of my own castle. I am, I am the captain of myself. Okay. I do not have to do anything that you want me to do. I am in charge of me. And if what I'm doing doesn't harm anyone, I should be completely allowed. And I'm well within every right, my God given rights to continue doing that thing.\n\nThat is a new idea in the world. It's a baby idea. It's only 250 some odd years old and not quite 250 yet. It's only about 250 years old. And we have to protect that idea because that's the most important idea in the history of the world thus far. And every time I see Americans exercise it and say, a second. Sometimes Americans get caught up in this thing where they're listening to people they shouldn't be listening to.\n\nYou know, they're to the television, Rachel Maddow or whoever, Joy Reid, Whoopi Goldberg. And then they go, wait a second, why? They just wake up and they go, why have I been listening to this bitch? What the fuck am I doing listening to this person? I'm just gonna do whatever the fuck I want. No! I'm doing what I want!\n\nErik Cason (01:00:18.705)\nWell, Hoddle's out now because he did what he wanted. Look, these are really important.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:00:23.144)\nWait, is your computer okay?\n\nHODL (01:00:24.984)\nI didn't mean to hit the computer, but it's okay, it's fine.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:00:28.072)\nI thought that was for dramatic effect.\n\nErik Cason (01:00:28.409)\nThe, the, yeah, it was good. These are really important ideals and like, you know, to, reemphasize everything that you said, Walker, like it took me a long time on my own journey as an anarchist. So like, like I'm an, I'm an anarchist and I'm American. Like I fundamentally believe that Americans on a whole, like we have all of the same value sets. Like nobody wants to hurt other people. Nobody wants to be hurt. People want to respect each other's right to private property. People want to see innovative and creative solutions and\n\nand like let people be freaky and do what they are. And so like, I see reactions on both sides. It's like, look, like if you want to be your gay transgender lizard or like whatever the fuck you want to identify as, like that's fucking great. Good for you. Like do not come into the fucking schools and try to teach kids that shit. Like I'm uninterested in that. In fact, like why the fuck are we doing this school thing? Like if you look at the fucking department of education, you know what every single standard has been measured to do each year?\n\nIt goes fucking down. That's what it does. It teaches kids to be fucking stupid little robots that can't think for themselves. Like it, I find it deeply disturbing when I, when my son has friends that are in public school come over and like how fucking remedial they are and how much they, don't, there's a certain creativity that they really lack that I find fucking disturbing, you know? And also on the same side, like just cause people want to be weirdos and freaks don't mean that we have to hate on them and remove their right to be fucking weirdos and freaks. It's just like, don't.\n\nIn the same way that like, I'm not going to put my shit in your face. Don't put your shit in my face and don't try to use public institutions to do that. There's no fucking need. Same thing. Like I have no fucking interest in deporting people from this country just because they disagree with me on different principles. Like we need to learn to live in fucking peace and have a radical modernism between us because without that, they're like that. That's what America is all about is about being able to figure out.\n\nHow do we live with these ideals that allow for us all to flourish despite how different we are? know, like Europeans like take a fucking cue from us. Like, you know, like we, we figured out how to make this shit work. You guys are trying to model the same thing, but to be very clear, like what you guys are doing with the European Central Bank and the EU and shit, like this is not going to end well for you guys. And so I really encourage\n\nErik Cason (01:02:47.665)\nAnd like I've noticed this more coming from German specifically like you guys need to redouble in your own nationalism and so far of that like you guys are actual independent countries and you need to stop letting this fucked up institution that got created by a bunch of bureaucrats that told you that everything was gonna get better with it. You know like I have an uncle that's lived in Berlin since the 1970s and he knows the conversion of when they went from the mark to the euro fucked everybody over super hard and that's how it is kind of universally.\n\nYou guys should really consider taking back national sovereignty, destroying the European Central Bank, and probably, you know, the fact that the thing is ran by an actual fucking financial criminal who has been found guilty of financial crimes, that's pretty fucking ridiculous. And it's pretty ridiculous that you guys tolerate this bullshit being shoved down your throat from Brussels, so...\n\nI really hope that you guys are gonna light shit on fire, cause like, when you guys commit yourself to burning shit down and like throwing shit at people and other stuff, you guys are really good at it. Like, into that. Like keep doing more of that. Like stop, stop with this other fucking nonsense. Cause you know, you guys are gonna get something pretty nasty out of it if you guys keep tolerating this bullshit.\n\nHODL (01:04:03.836)\nYou know what I think the difference between the European mind and the American mind is is that in Europe for you know, thousands of years, if you talk back to the nobility, they could kill you with impunity, right? And in America, one day we took a look at the nobility and we were like, fuck you. We just killed everybody, bro. You know, and so that's different starting points, you know, inception.\n\nErik Cason (01:04:24.048)\nYup, fun f-\n\nErik Cason (01:04:27.868)\nFun fact is that there is an actual amendment to the United States Constitution that is still active to be ratified by states that if you are given a title of nobility in America, you will be stripped of all political rights and positions. think it was the, because there's like three outstanding articles that could be ratified by states, like aren't, like another is about like child labor. The other one's article the first, which.\n\nHODL (01:04:49.706)\nYeah.\n\nErik Cason (01:04:53.424)\nI've had another great radical plan of like forcing state legislatures to ratify article the first to be, and it's called that because it was the first article to ever be that passed through the congressional approval process. And it went to the States to get approved, but it was never approved. And what article the first stipulates is that no representative of the federal government shall ever represent any more than 50,000 people at a time. And to be clear, if that passed today, that would mean that the House of Representatives would be like,\n\n7,000 people or some shit like that. So that would be really fun if we like got states to pass it just to fuck up the federal government. Cause this is my big thing that I want not only for Americans, but for Europeans and all people everywhere is that like, I believe very, very strongly it is about states, provinces and counties against their unified federal government. Like if you look at what's going on in Spain right now, after the crisis that happened in Valencia and how much the federal government is absolutely fucking those people over.\n\nThis is where the real war is at. So I'd like to see more radicalism of states' rights against federal governments across the board. And I think that would really help solve a lot of problems.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:06:02.717)\nEric, you mentioned something earlier about, like, just speaking of states' rights, that if, what was it, 35 states were to basically resolve internally, like, as independent states, that we should end the Fed, that the federal government would basically need to scramble. Can you elaborate on that a little bit more for those of us who are less constitutionally literate?\n\nErik Cason (01:06:20.71)\nYeah, so this is all a hypothetical way to be able to ratify the United States Constitution directly using state legislatures only. Nothing has to go through the federal government and it is not supposed to have any oversight. This has never happened in American history because every single time that this method has been used to amend the Constitution, when it's gotten within two or three states,\n\nThe federal government has essentially flipped the fuck out and Congress has passed that amendment to the United States with the same language directly so that this was all circumnavigated. There was a Supreme Court decision in 1908 that essentially said if states tried to do this, we wouldn't recognize it. But like this is all about creating constitutional crisis because the 10th Amendment is very explicit and that any powers that are not enumerated to the federal government directly in the Constitution are reserved for states alone. So.\n\nThe whole idea would be essentially be go state by state, get the exact same language passed saying that we are calling on an Article 5 convention to amend the United States Constitution to end the Federal Reserve and that the federal government shall have no oversight whatsoever around the issuance of a currency. And in theory, it could pass. For me, the big goal is to get it past 33 states or something.\n\nfederal government's gonna freak out. You're probably gonna have the judicial branch being like, no, this is illegitimate. There's no way to amend the constitution without the federal government. We're gonna be like, Texas, what do you think about that? They're trying to say that the sovereignty of your state and what you guys decide isn't okay. Is that something you agree with? How do you feel about that, Nevada, Wyoming? Is this okay with you guys?\n\nCause for me, the big crisis that happened in America, which is where fiat money started in America was during the civil war. And as much as everybody likes to suck Abraham Lincoln's dick and celebrate him as being a really great guy, good job with like ending slavery, but like you like really fucked up a lot of other stuff with what you did in that. Not to mention that like explicitly creating an amendment to the United States constitution that says that other people can't have slaves, but the\n\nErik Cason (01:08:28.913)\nthe state itself can have slaves is pretty fucked up. So with that, I really encourage everybody look into the Article 5 ratification process. I really have a boner for the idea using this to like fuck up the federal government across the board. Because to me, this is actually about a radical evolution of the political process that like I think federal politics is fundamentally broken. And if there's a way to lateralize a national movement that uses\n\nonly states and state legislatures to start amending the Constitution, or even calling for an Article 5 convention to rewrite the Constitution on a whole, which is also specifically reserved by Article 5 in the U.S. Constitution, there's actually an opportunity for us to roll back radical federal power, destroy the deep state, and renew the American dream throughout the globe by essentially creating the American dream with the federal government and the deep state stripped from it. So that's kind of my insane idea.\n\nyou know, let's have a couple lawyers and legal scholars come in here and tell me how I'm fucking insane or wrong or maybe even right, but as far as I know, this is an actual thing that could happen. It's just been kind of buried in history for a long time.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:09:41.32)\nHODL your thoughts.\n\nHODL (01:09:43.512)\nI listen, I'm an Article 5 maxi as well. Eric has explained it to me multiple times. just, you know, I think like in practical terms, I just I just don't think we're gonna be able to do that. Yeah, it'd be cool. It'd be cool if it happened. You know, I would be for it.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:10:00.4)\nLet's let's talk about some practical terms then because okay I want to want to get your guys take on this whole Bitcoin strategic reserve thing Senator okay, so you we remember at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville Trump gave what I think was honestly incredible stand-up performance like that dudes a dude he riffs like he's he's Like you cannot argue with the fact that the dude can fucking what does he call? He calls it the weave right? You know like he riffs. It's impressive. It's just\n\nHODL (01:10:20.344)\nIt was funny. Yeah.\n\nHODL (01:10:25.91)\nleave.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:10:28.702)\nvery like nice routine. yeah. Yeah. Go save the delivery man. But, and he talked kind of like, we're going to keep the Bitcoin that we have, you know, we're not going to sell any of it. He didn't like explicitly say we are going to start, you know, printing fiat to acquire Bitcoin. He said he would protect the industry though. He said a lot of positive things. Then as everybody is leaving the stage, like after he finished, Lummis comes up and is like, I have a fucking bill right here. Like\n\nErik Cason (01:10:29.088)\nMy dogs are attacking the delivery man, so I gotta stop them.\n\nHODL (01:10:31.416)\nNope.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:10:57.703)\nI have a bill for the US to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and like I felt bad because like again like people are like yelling like everyone's leaving the thing like and I'm sitting there like she just like this is fucking actually actually news that lumos is like I've got a fucking bill for this she's been on top of it since then Do what do you think is the most likely scenario that's gonna play out as far as the establishment of a strategic reserve? Is this something that like Trump is gonna be all for?\n\nHODL (01:11:05.442)\nYeah.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:11:24.455)\nLike once he gets a little more knowledge of it, where do you think we're going with this?\n\nHODL (01:11:27.348)\nSo the way that Trump said it on stage initially is is wrong and can't happen. So the Bitcoin that have been seized, you know by whomever, whichever government authority sees them, then there are multiple government authorities that have seized them over time. They belong to somebody they have owners, right? So like most recently the Bitfinex hack there was four billion dollars worth of Bitcoin or something that was seized by the US government, but that Bitcoin all belongs to\n\npeople and it has to go back to them. So you can't use it for your national strategic stockpile. But in general, I think the idea of a national strategic stockpile is something that is going to happen one way or another. I think it's inevitable. Whether it goes on the central bank's balance sheet or whether it's put into the hands of the executive branch, I'm not sure. But America is going to acquire a large swath of Bitcoin at some point.\n\nI think there's a the most interesting thing about it is the prisoners dilemma of the nation state level game theory around who goes first So if you go first, you're the most advantaged, right? But for some reason I don't think this is widely known and so nobody's gone first yet or maybe it's because we don't have Younger people who understand these things or have game this out Is Trump's administration administration where we we can do those things I think\n\nMaybe I mean, JD Vance is a Bitcoin or Vivek is a Bitcoin or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a Bitcoin or Tulsi Gabbard is a Bitcoin or Elon Musk is a Bitcoin or Trump owns a little bit of Bitcoin. He's dabbled in some crypto bullshit. He has his own shit coin. So yeah, I mean, there is a potential that it could happen this time around. I think the most important or the most interesting thing to me is the game theory between other nation states. And then the thing I was going to mention is in some\n\nTo some degree, I think the Bitcoin that's in the public markets is a honeypot for the US government. So MSTR is a honeypot for the US government. The ETFs are the public companies that have Bitcoin on treasury like Tesla. So those things are things that can be nationalized in a moment's notice if needed. But we're not on a Bitcoin standard. So the government doesn't need to seize your Bitcoin yet. If fiat starts to collapse, they may need to seize your Bitcoin.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:13:33.256)\nMm.\n\nHODL (01:13:56.273)\nThey may seize your b- They'll never need to do it. I mean, they just will do it, right? And so, yeah, I think that's- Those are my high-level thoughts around everything, though.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:14:04.595)\nDo you, I assume when you talk about a first mover advantage, you're discounting El Salvador in this particular instance because they do not print their own currency, because they are dollarized. Yeah.\n\nHODL (01:14:12.756)\nIt's too small. Well, it's also too small. It's just too small. El Salvador is a very poor country. They're doing listen, they're doing great. They're on the upswing, but they're not a player in the world. They don't mean anything like I mean, El Salvador is a tiny nothing country with no resources like I love what's going on down there. You're always probably they're very small. If you looked at them on the map, it's like this big. It's yeah, it's Russia, China, America.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:14:28.105)\nFor now, for now, for now, let's let's let, yeah.\n\nHODL (01:14:41.238)\nFrance, Germany, those are the countries that one of them needs to go first. G7.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:14:45.897)\nDo you so I mean like Russia has been shifting some of its stances around Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin more generally recently. mean do you think that like that is like we're going to see a lot more of that because Russia was for a while very like no we're you know not a fan of this. mean you know it's not the not the freest country in the world let's say and so freedom money tends to be a little bit.\n\nIt's like oil and water, like they don't mix well, right? But clearly they're realizing the geopolitical significance of Bitcoin, which is still sitting at like, I mean, I don't know what the market cap is right now after we're over, we're pamping, but like, we're not over 2 trillion yet. We're at like what, below a trillion and a half, like 1.5, which is fucking nothing. Like in the grand scheme of things, like we are still fucking early.\n\nErik Cason (01:15:31.04)\npoint five.\n\nHODL (01:15:37.74)\nYep. Smaller than Apple Computer.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:15:42.303)\nYeah, Bitcoin did just pass meta though, right? I think like today like I believe so, but I don't know like\n\nHODL (01:15:47.308)\nProbably.\n\nErik Cason (01:15:52.717)\nThat piece of shit company is worth one and a half tru- Like what the fuck is wrong with this world? I'm sorry, like that- that is upsetting that so many fucking morons are on that goddamn surveillance platform giving away their information towards somebody that fucking hates them.\n\nHODL (01:16:02.38)\nIt's.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:16:06.473)\nto, it's just,\n\nHODL (01:16:08.214)\nInstagram is very popular with the hoes Eric very popular\n\nErik Cason (01:16:11.434)\nI know. Bitches just be scrolling.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:16:12.551)\nAnd Facebook's very popular with the boomers. Like I think boomers are the only ones left on Facebook. I'm honestly convinced, which is hilarious because the boomers were the same ones being like this, this, these Facebook's are going to melt your brains. And now they're like, you know, like this picture of Donald Trump and Jesus is incredible. Like when did they take this? This is amazing. Like, don't think boomer boomers have really bad AI detection skills. Also, that's a slight digression, but it leaves them very vulnerable to manipulation. I think\n\nHODL (01:16:24.342)\nIt's, yeah.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:16:40.456)\nIt's also kind of cute and endearing. God bless you, you bought your house for two raspberries and now you're a multimillionaire.\n\nErik Cason (01:16:47.724)\nlook like in all honesty, like I see the next decade is like there's gonna be this really it's funny because I remember I was at Burning Man. I'd taken a bunch of acid and I was talking to a younger friend about this and I like went on this crazy diatribe. was like, yeah, in 30 years, we're gonna have like a youth fascist movement that's just gonna be all about like fucking stripping the boomers of their property and like sending them off to the prison camps for liquidation just because people are gonna be so fucking angry at the way that they feel like they were robbed and stolen from. So like\n\nI don't know. It's very similar to that Junseth podcast where he talked to that young scammer where he was pretty indifferent to the way he was ripping people off. honestly, young people have a pretty good point. Yeah, if an AI boomer can't tell the difference between Donald Trump and an AI bot, and you can rip him off doing that, why shouldn't you? Yeah, he made his millions of dollars from watching his house inflate.\n\nHODL (01:17:21.57)\nof these cameras.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:17:23.049)\nwas amazing.\n\nErik Cason (01:17:46.102)\nyou know, because of how fucked up the monetary system is. So why shouldn't you just engage in outright graft? I'm not saying that that's right in any meaningful way. Like it's an honest and open-ended question that frankly, I've really struggled with, like meaningfully answering to them. Cause like, yeah, this system has absolutely fucked you and robbed you. And there is no meaningful way that you are going to crawl out of the hole that you've been forced to live in. So like, I don't, I don't know what you can really do to try to protect yourself other than get yourself on a Bitcoin standard.\n\nHODL (01:18:15.108)\nyou? Do you that's Do you think that's true, though? Because like, didn't you feel that way when you were 1819? Because I did, I felt like the boomers had pulled up the ladder. They got rich selling houses back and forth to each other. We were never going to be able to do the same thing, etc, etc. And then God was just like, boom, here's, here's digital coins, bitch. And I was like, fuck. This is amazing. I'm richer than these guys could have ever dreamed. Yeah.\n\nErik Cason (01:18:15.414)\nBut you probably shouldn't be robbing people, because that's fucked up.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:18:18.344)\nYeah\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:18:38.045)\nyou\n\nYou\n\nHODL (01:18:43.158)\nSo I mean, think there's always something on the horizon.\n\nErik Cason (01:18:43.567)\nI mean, for me personally, for me personally, yeah, but like, I, and like, this is one of the things I always struggle with is that like, we're in an extremely unique position, you know, across, like, that's one of the reasons I didn't just like take the money and run is that like, feel a real obligation towards speaking to the very real power that this has to like, write the economy in a meaningful way again. And with that being said, like,\n\nIf I was 20 years old looking at the economy right now, like I would very sincerely be trying to build a career as probably both a drug dealer and a scammer just because I look at the world and be like, why the fuck should I participate in any of this goddamn non- like you want me to fork out $400,000 to get a fucking bachelor's degree while you got that shit for free? Like why the fuck shouldn't I just set fire to everything and watch it burn because\n\nWhat do I have to win in this system? Like, like I can work for 30 fucking years so I can get a down payment on a home that then I'll spend the next 30 fucking years trying to pay off scraping by. Like, I think shit is really, really fucked up. And I think the only reason that kids aren't outraged is because they're so dopamine addicted to the scrolling that they can't even pull their head far enough out of the phone to stop and look around and go, gee, shit's really fucking bad. But that terrifies them. So they look back at the phone and keep scrolling.\n\nso I think shit's kind of sad right now, but, you know, like I, I hope I'm wrong and that it's not actually that dark out there, but from the, from the young people that I speak to, like, there isn't a rage about it. There's like a very real defeat that like they have been beaten down into a cage that like, they're just doing their best to figure out how to be in. So, while I do agree that I did feel that way when I was younger, like I very sincerely feel like I just like found the fucking glitch in the system.\n\nAnd I remember like picking it up and being like, there's no fucking way that like magic internet money is going to become the global standard of the future and like make a difference in the 2024 presidential election. And the funniest thing is, that like, there was no political conversation about Bitcoin in my opinion, up until about 2016. Like there were, there was no conceivable difference. know, like crypto didn't even exist on a whole. There was a bunch of shit coin copies, like Litecoin and Feathercoin and shit.\n\nErik Cason (01:21:07.812)\nBut it was only with the premiere of Ethereum that Bitcoiners were like, hang on, like, we're trying to like make a kind of money that you can't fuck with. And they're like, yeah, like I thought, I thought this was the whole thing that we could just like make up Clowncoin and like make a bunch of money. And I was like, I think we have like different ethics here. And they're like, huh. So like, you don't want any Clowncoin? And I was like, no.\n\nGood luck with that though.\n\nHODL (01:21:32.28)\nNo, mean, you know, I think that, okay, so one thing is, did you see the scammers who got caught for 250 million? They hit up a Genesis creditor for 250 million. Did you see that story?\n\nErik Cason (01:21:44.022)\nyeah, yeah. Wasn't this a while ago that they just, you it was like, he had like fucking, like two FAA, like through texts or some shit and they just, just, yeah.\n\nHODL (01:21:52.438)\nYeah, they posed as I think they pose as Genesis or so I can't remember how the scam worked. But anyway, like they got $250 million in Bitcoin off of this guy. And it wasn't that long ago. was like six months ago or something. And then what did they do? They went out to the clubs in Miami and LA and they started buying OnlyFans girls Birkin bags and Lamborghinis and whatever. And my favorite text message from the thread is by the way, and then the FBI caught them two months later because\n\nEverybody who's ever seen Goodfellas knows you don't go out and buy a fucking pink Cadillac day one. Are you fucking retarded? Robert De Niro is gonna whack you, okay? Or they don't watch it? Yeah, it's like, the kid literally bought a pink, he bought a pink Lambo for a girl. That is in Goodfellas, the guy does that and then he gets whacked.\n\nErik Cason (01:22:29.509)\nKids don't watch oldies anymore.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:22:31.567)\nNo, the answers are all there. They gave you the answers.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:22:41.425)\nAlso, like she's not going to bang you either way, bro. Like, you know, seriously,\n\nHODL (01:22:43.704)\nWell, that's the point. That's the point I'm getting to. So there's a text message from the girl and he goes, hey, what's up? I bought you a fucking pink Lambo Urus. You want it? Let's be friends, whatever. And she's like, lol, I have a boyfriend. Sorry. And it's like, dude, you are going to get ass raped in federal prison for the next 10 years.\n\nErik Cason (01:22:44.377)\nYeah, that's like the most beta fucking move you can make.\n\nHODL (01:23:09.568)\nand you couldn't even get the girl to sleep with you after you bought her a fucking Lamborghini. You know why? It's because when you earn money that way, girls know. They know that you're a fucking loser. They can feel it. They can sense it. Right? And so like she didn't want to have anything to do with you. So it's like, what did you get out of the score, bro? You went to Rodeo Drive and wore some gay Louis Vuitton shit for a little bit and we're in the nightclub fucking sipping on fucking...\n\nawesome, Migo, fucking Don Hoolit, whatever the fuck, like what the f- that's nothing. You threw away your life for nothing, bro. Come on.\n\nErik Cason (01:23:41.263)\nYeah, not to digress, but like if you want to like get rich and make a bunch of money to like get all the hot bitches, like I got news for you. Like it's not gonna work in any meaningful way. And like, you're actually gonna find yourself in like a super bitch beta position where you're gonna be like, huh, like I just like drove this girl in my Porsche over to this guy's house that she's like, that isn't my boyfriend. So.\n\nHODL (01:24:06.808)\nIt's just her trainer dude, it's just her trainer dude. He's the only guy who can work her glutes right bro, it's a thing.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:24:09.639)\nIt's just Pilates instructor. It's cool, man.\n\nErik Cason (01:24:12.716)\nYeah.\n\nI'm going to, you know, she needs me to pick her up in a half hour. So I'm just, I'm going to hang out at this coffee shop just cause I wonder why she's doing only a half hour of Pilate though. That's kind of weird.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:24:24.735)\nThat's strange. Doesn't seem like enough to get a good burn.\n\nHODL (01:24:25.836)\nwas like a... No, dude, it's more intense sweat, dude. If you do it that way, it's what...\n\nErik Cason (01:24:31.644)\nWell, and look, the... This is all part of the general nihilism that's playing out, because like when you get that money, when you get money that easily, that quickly through doing dumb shit like scamming, like you're not going to like stop and be like, whoa, like I finally got the lotto ticket to get out of here. Like I'm going to buy a couple of laundry mats and maybe like, you know, like a driving range and a couple other places that can really generate some cashflow for me.\n\nNo, you're gonna do like a bunch of retarded shit like that and you're gonna blow the money. like, this is one of the things I love the most about Bitcoin. It's like, Bitcoin doesn't solve cashflow problems or if like you don't have any meaningful like model that you're operating from the world from. if you can't save money, like you will not have any fucking Bitcoin. But like, if you're somebody who's like thoughtful and saving money and you have like a 401k and you've like played their game and gotten fucked by that, like.\n\nBitcoin's going to be hugely helpful for you because like now you're actually going to have a like savings that like does the thing it's supposed to do. So good on you. And also like, I'm sorry for all the younger kids that are getting fucked by this system that hates them. Like you really should be on only a Bitcoin standard. And if you're not, like I, I would love to hear your solution on why we're fucking dumb and you have the solution. Cause as far as I can tell.\n\nYou're gonna work at a Starbucks for the next 30 years and live in your mom's basement and like maybe, maybe if you want a family, you'll have like a chihuahua or something like, look, I got two dogs right now. Like these motherfuckers eat like nobody's business. So like get a really small dog that like you, you like don't need to like feed a lot of food to.\n\nHODL (01:26:08.075)\nDude, you know what though, it's all mentality, truly. It's like, people don't, when you talk about like having children and caring about yourself for the future and you know, making money and how making money is a good thing, younger people are just straight up confused, right? And to us, that's like, that's the default that we grew up in. Those are our values. And yeah, but younger people are like, what? Is this some sort of like, trad, like trad?\n\nChad movement thing, dude. And you're like, what? This is called being a normal person, retard. What are you talking about? And it's because it's so like they haven't heard it. They've been being dude, if you go to public school, you have been being lectured by cat ladies eight hours a day for a fucking 15 years. OK, like and they have like fucking unicorn fairy tattoos on them and stuff. And they're like, Donald Trump is a racist. That's what you've been dealing with.\n\nErik Cason (01:26:46.577)\nYou can't say that word anymore.\n\nHODL (01:27:06.432)\nOkay, so you come out of that and then Andrew Tate's like, if you want to be a fucking man, you gotta have a fucking Bugatti. And then you go, fuck, this is fucking speaking to me, dude. Right? Like, when we were young, that was just like common sense. It was like, yeah, sports cars and hot chicks. Like that's what we like, bro. Like, you know.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:27:26.162)\nNobody needs to tell you that dude. Like, yeah.\n\nErik Cason (01:27:26.46)\nI feel...\n\nI feel really fucking bad for younger people. Like particularly like if you're like a young guy going through puberty and like you want to like go talk to this girl, but you're all nervous because you've watched all this like cancel culture shit. Like now you're too terrified to ever go talk to her. And now like you haven't talked to any girls in your whole life and you want to, but you can't. So like you feel like total fucking wiener. And then like somebody was like, well, if you feel like a wiener and like being a man's really hard, like maybe you're a woman and they're like, maybe I am a woman. And like,\n\nIt's something, it's fucked up. It's really wrong. And like a lot of times these poor kids just need somebody to be like, yeah, like you need to go talk to the woman. She could possibly like get really upset and sue you or some shit, but chances are she's just going to think you're kind of weird and you'll feel uncomfortable and walk away, you know, being blown out and like, that's okay. That that's part of life. It's okay when a woman rejects you. doesn't define you as a human being.\n\nHODL (01:28:17.56)\nI'm not supposed to say this but if you're a teenage boy Go and get a little drunk and do donuts in a parking lot. Okay. I'm not supposed to say that you probably shouldn't do it, but you know You should probably do it. Yeah, like in an empty parking lot empty. Don't go on the road. Just Donuts you can do it in don't do\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:28:31.498)\nGreat advice. It's terrible advice, but it's great advice.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:28:41.608)\nAnd honestly, you live in the mid-west, like wait until, like you've got a little bit of snow there, wait until it's a little bit slick, it's much safer to do the donuts when your wheels are actually sliding versus you're like burning rubber. So that, we're tempering the donut device with some good Midwestern, you know, logical advice there. You know, I think, and Hodel, know you've got a hard stop coming up soon. I think we may need to do an entire other...\n\nHODL (01:28:57.653)\nAbsolutely.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:29:08.702)\nshow about the fact that you know who hates homeschooling and who has had homeschooling illegal for a long time. Germany. Thank you. It's it's I appreciate you knew where I was going with that. And you know who implemented that. It was the fucking Nazis. Why did they implement the fact that you can't it is illegal for you to homeschool your kids for you to raise and instruct your kids at home.\n\nHODL (01:29:18.754)\nGermany, right?\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:29:34.868)\nbecause they wanted to fucking control the narrative and control your kids and indoctrinate them and make them good little fucking Hitler's youth Nazis. And then we can go back a little bit further to the Prussian system of education, which is like what kind of was the genesis of the Nazi system, which is we want to create great little worker bees and great little soldiers. And the only way we can do that is if we have control of them from the first time they're able to fucking formulate a word.\n\nUntil they are of a you an age where it's appropriate to send them off to fucking work until they die or fight until they die I digress a little bit but the point is that if you don't like homeschooling you're a nazi And I mean that literally not like the everyone's a nazi thing like you're literally agreeing with what the nazis wanted So congratulations. You're a literal nazi not a figurative nazi That's\n\nI just wanted to get that off my chest a little bit guys as a homeschooled guy myself who then went to public school because my parents Said it's your fucking decision do what you want to do. They didn't swear at me at that time They just said it's your decision, but I added the fucking but That was a fucking trip getting into public school and realizing I thought I was gonna be real stupid That was like my big worry where I was like mom and dad I think I should go to public school like what if I'm not as smart as the other kids They're always all my friends that I play sports with they're always doing homework and all this extra work like they've to be way ahead of me\n\nThey're like, okay, that's your decision. You can decide to do that. But like you've got a you know, like it's your it's your choice So anything that comes with it's your you know your responsibility, okay? And then I got to school and I was like, my god, everybody is fucking stupid. shit They are catering to the lowest common denominator. And this is a fucking joke I dig and I'm not even like that smart like I was smart enough to be a valedictorian and like kind of a bumblefucky town but that's like, you know, like you're the\n\nskinniest kid at fat camp. You know what I mean? Like it's like, okay, like nice, nice job, but like you're still fat. Like, Hey, Hey, you guys are, you know,\n\nErik Cason (01:31:31.689)\nThere are all these kids from her high school listening right now, and I'm like, hey, I'm not that dumb.\n\nHODL (01:31:35.316)\nHey, I often walk here. I often walk in my glue and he sniffed it. I thought we were friends.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:31:42.305)\nI knew some fucking great fucking people and there were also some great fucking teachers in there who actually were like fuck this administrative bullshit. I'm just going to actually teach these kids. They were also the teachers always getting in trouble with the administration for like you're not following the curriculum. know like but and like I fucking love the small town that I grew up in because there are fucking great people there. The point is that the public school system did no one any favors. And you know what you just don't fucking need it man. You should do like\n\nAn hour or two of school a day and you'll be fucking good. That's all I did And then I went and started fires like not pyro fires But like I like to start controlled fires who doesn't you know what I mean? That's part of it And if you're a young guy listening to this and you've never just gone and started a fire fucking a go and start a fire because No, self-respecting woman will marry you unless you can start a fire like and I'm just telling you Yeah\n\nErik Cason (01:32:31.926)\nYeah, do it on metal trash can though, or like somewhere that you're not gonna start forest fire. know, like Smokey the Bear had a point.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:32:37.258)\nWell, yeah, don't do yet again not pyromaniac fires start controlled fires Learn how to control them and be a responsible member of society who knows how to make flame like fucking hey That's the only reason that we started drinking bone marrow that was actually cooked and had our brains grow and you want to spit on that I don't think so I've digressed a little bit but it felt like I needed to digress a little bit to get us off track enough for hodl for me to allow you to make a graceful exit here How much more time you got you got time for one last?\n\nHODL (01:33:05.928)\ngot, yeah, I got like five more minutes. I can do five more minutes.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:33:06.81)\nthought Okay, okay, so Okay, it first. I just want to say thank you to everybody who tuned in on this Noster only live stream fuck YouTube fuck live stream on Twitter fuck wherever else you can live stream like twitch I've never used it, but I hear the kids do all these sats that you guys have sent which is almost 50,000 sats which is awesome I'm gonna send them all to open sats and provide receipts. So thank you guys for doing that We're gonna fund some open source development while shitting on ridiculous people\n\nErik Cason (01:33:10.21)\ndiatribe.\n\nHODL (01:33:34.072)\nYeah.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:33:36.352)\nClosing thoughts, gentlemen. Hodel, you want to kick us off?\n\nHODL (01:33:40.888)\nYeah, let me think about this here for a second. What are my closing thoughts? I think...\n\nin general, you gotta just keep living, man. No, I got nothing.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:33:57.792)\nYeah, you don't have to have that. You already dropped so much wisdom. Well, Eric, what about you? What do want to leave people with?\n\nHODL (01:34:04.561)\nCome back to me. Do Eric first, then come back.\n\nErik Cason (01:34:10.474)\nLook, Trump getting elected was like a the whole market was like waiting to see whether or not we're going to go into like socialism hell or if there's going to be an opportunity for something meaningful to happen. Now something meaningful is going to happen and Bitcoin is going to rip super fucking hard in the next six months. And so like if you've been like, I've been like, stacking a little here and there, but I got my 401k like you don't have enough fucking coin. You're going to want more coin later and you should stack harder. So you should really consider about like\n\nPut, you know, like stop messing around, like fucking shove it in, like, like put the whole thing in and enjoy what it means and be like, fucking go for it. In addition to, you know, you should really think for yourself, you know, like no, nobody actually has all of the right fucking answers. And if you actually spend some time and energy thinking hard about what your values are and what you want for the world and for yourself, you're probably going to come to some great conclusions. you know,\n\nSo I really hope that more of you are going to fly your freak freak flags and like do your own thing. Walker, you're a great example. You're just doing the Bitcoin podcast to swipe the fact that Bitcoin podcasts were saturated as fuck. You were just like, you know what? I'm going to try my own fucking thing. Turns out people like you and like listen to you. So even if it seems in other people are like, hey, this is saturated. There's too many people like go do you and what you're supposed to like, that's what the world wants. That's where you're to find your power and that's where you're going to make the most money. Don't wait for somebody to be like,\n\nYou need to call a degree in to suck five dicks at this law firm to get a job to practice law. find, like, find the fucking hack. Figure out the way that you can actually go do the thing that you want to do. What is the world wants for you and other people want for you? The system does not fucking want for you. Like realize that right now, you're going to be way fucking ahead for yourself. So.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:35:36.02)\nYou\n\nErik Cason (01:35:53.28)\nI hope to see all of you young entrepreneurs with the production of all of the great and wonderful things that you will be accepting only on a Bitcoin standard because you're smart enough that you don't want to get fucked holding a bunch of fiat that's going to go to zero. That's the end of what I have to\n\nHODL (01:36:06.496)\nI am. I actually do have something to say I was I was thinking about this. I think going into the bull market, an important message for people that they need to be aware of is that, yes, you should go hard. know, there's that clip of me on Walker show saying stack your fucking ass off and all that. And like, yes, you should go hard. You should you should be here. You should be fully committed to this and you should be, you know, investing a significant portion of what you have available. All true.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:36:06.728)\nA fucking\n\nHODL (01:36:34.648)\nbut you know in bull markets people take leverage and Leverage is something that people mistakenly think is a time machine to being an og And it's not and you know, we've seen a lot of people get wrecked So if you are gonna take leverage be extremely careful it's it's one of those things that like if you warn enough people about doing it the people that\n\nyou know, ignore all the warnings and walk through all the warning signs anyway, and then go do it and succeed. They were always meant to succeed. But for the vast majority of people like you won't succeed. You know what mean? So like you really should heed the warning and only you know if you're that person or not, and everybody thinks they are that person. But you only find out you're not that person who can walk through all the warning signs until you get fucking destroyed. So don't get destroyed. You know what I mean? Like\n\nErik Cason (01:37:24.676)\nBy the way, this is being said by the man who made a Bitcoin by betting the man who had the leverage platform that his leverage platform would go bankrupt within a year and it fucking did. just saying that Hoddle might actually know a little bit about what the fuck he's talking about. So with that, please don't go long and slam your fucking dick in the door because there's a 10 % drawdown, which could very well happen when we hit an all time high and your retarded ass did a 10X long and didn't realize.\n\nHODL (01:37:32.728)\nThat's right.\n\nErik Cason (01:37:51.928)\nthat that's what happens. You get fucking liquidated when the price goes down. So don't be fucking retarded and lose the little bit of Bitcoin that you have because you thought that you could get more Bitcoin because you were smarter. You're not. You're a normal fucking person who will hurt yourself if you do that. So sorry, I just really wanted to add.\n\nHODL (01:38:07.746)\nSo no, % 100 % and two cardinal sins here in Bitcoin you need to be aware of heading into the bull market is number one, not being bullish enough on Bitcoin. That's the biggest sin. It's the biggest sin anyone can make. Number two, unfortunately, is being too bullish on Bitcoin. So you got to strike the balance right in the middle there. Because if you're on either side, you're getting fucking wrecked. Okay, so the best way to do that, stack your Bitcoin, hodl your Bitcoin.\n\ndo it in self custody, do it in cold storage, do it with a multi sig. Don't go crazy on this, these products, these MSTU and BTU and fucking these leverage products you can now get access to in the markets. Don't go crazy on MSTR stock, don't go crazy on shit coins or meme coins. You know, everybody has a plan. I've met a lot of guys who had a plan to get to 100 Bitcoin, who ended up with zero Bitcoin, right? So like,\n\nTry not to be one of those guys. If your plan has three elaborate steps that involve you hitting a million shot three times, you're not gonna execute that plan, man. I couldn't execute it. I don't know why you think you're good enough to. I don't know why anyone would ever think they're good enough to. Be smart.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:39:20.83)\ngot a fucking three step plan and it's called DCA and fucking like literally guys, none of us are as smart as we think we are. And like that's good. Like you being too smart is just a pain. That's why you know, that's why you need to drink and stuff. But like literally just like just fucking DCA. Like it's actually like just this GCO like you can just buy Bitcoin, set up a daily DCA buy and then set up an hourly DCA buy.\n\nHODL (01:39:24.503)\nYes.\n\nHODL (01:39:38.828)\nTotally.\n\nWalker (BitcoinPodcast.net) (01:39:49.492)\nand it'll just split the difference and you will be in large profit in the long term. And I have not been around as long as you guys been around since 2020 and I just dollar cost average. And you know what? It works. And I try to create some value. And Eric, to your point, I appreciate that, that you see this journey that I'm on creating another fucking Bitcoin podcast. But I just want to say until there are more Bitcoin podcasts than insufferable fucking finance bro podcasts,\n\nThere are not enough Bitcoin podcasts. need to this needs to be the flippening where Bitcoin podcasts are more plentiful than fucking finance bro. Like here here's the real real estate stock stocks that you should buy that'll generate some passive income for you when you're 401k. It's like Jesus fucking Christ. Grow some balls and buy some Bitcoin guys. Yeah. I fucking appreciate you guys. Thanks for hopping on here. This this was a very enjoyable time.\n\nAnd I know that people fucking love hearing from both of you guys because you are principal dudes who always laid out straight and We are we are very blessed to have you in this fucking strange community of people and it's great to fucking hang out with you guys And I hope we can do it in fucking person over a beer again soon But yeah, hold on get the fuck out of here case it I'm you guys for everyone listening I'm gonna kill this live stream now and we're gonna just to make sure these guys are uploaded. So fucking love you all. Thanks for joining\n\nI'm killing it now.\n\n\n\n","sig":"20c228ae417f256c9983775258cd90526ca21756300e746b12524c669ad59561d041c783ecd8ac002b36e063b7c544a00779c6f05d843a366019e7245f0a2ac9"},"naddr1qqxnzdenxyunjwpc8yursdpcqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qte0uzs6vj29umjaxlqqct82j8q6ppyefrxq06dhr8d6pvwfatgkqxpqqqp65wxkp3d2":{"kind":30023,"id":"615412c9dab4f254652e901bf887ebb2e05f51168054af27c56206208cffe6cf","pubkey":"5e5fc1434c928bcdcba6f801859d5238341093291980fd36e33b7416393d5a2c","created_at":1732004513,"tags":[["d","1731998898848"],["title","User guide - Real-time Group Chat in Chachi.chat"],["summary","User guide - Real-time Group Chat in Chachi.chat"],["zap","5e5fc1434c928bcdcba6f801859d5238341093291980fd36e33b7416393d5a2c","wss://purplepag.es","93"],["zap","1237fba45b7df77b4cca2209dc68d208a4fa7384cce03b53ec6c862353705d6d","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","c5fadeb5d90d68baffc631455a07ca340ccf1e31110955e16d45eb5f87147cd9","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","4918eb332a41b71ba9a74b1dc64276cfff592e55107b93baae38af3520e55975","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","6b1b35c6dee48851bac53a4494ca8f819503be00212dbceb899dc03acd7641db","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","32e1827635450ebb3c5a7d12c1f8e7b2b514439ac10a67eef3d9fd9c5c68e245","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","84de35e2584d2b144aae823c9ed0b0f3deda09648530b93d1a2a146d1dea9864","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","7d4e04503ab26615dd5f29ec08b52943cbe5f17bacc3012b26220caa232ab14c","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["published_at","1731998950"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqhjlc9p5ey5teh96d7qpskw4ywp5zzfjjxvql5mwxwm5zcun6k3vqqxnzdenxyunjwpc8yursdpc7xfg82"],["zap","5e5fc1434c928bcdcba6f801859d5238341093291980fd36e33b7416393d5a2c","wss://purplepag.es","93"],["zap","1237fba45b7df77b4cca2209dc68d208a4fa7384cce03b53ec6c862353705d6d","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","c5fadeb5d90d68baffc631455a07ca340ccf1e31110955e16d45eb5f87147cd9","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","4918eb332a41b71ba9a74b1dc64276cfff592e55107b93baae38af3520e55975","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","6b1b35c6dee48851bac53a4494ca8f819503be00212dbceb899dc03acd7641db","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","32e1827635450ebb3c5a7d12c1f8e7b2b514439ac10a67eef3d9fd9c5c68e245","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","84de35e2584d2b144aae823c9ed0b0f3deda09648530b93d1a2a146d1dea9864","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","7d4e04503ab26615dd5f29ec08b52943cbe5f17bacc3012b26220caa232ab14c","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["published_at","1731998950"],["t","guide"],["t","chachi"],["t","nostr"],["t","group"],["t","groupchat"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/9fd1ee7301e299d663527fc3b8d41dbe513d742a7823427428c95b0fa51e4260.png "],["zap","5e5fc1434c928bcdcba6f801859d5238341093291980fd36e33b7416393d5a2c","wss://purplepag.es","93"],["zap","1237fba45b7df77b4cca2209dc68d208a4fa7384cce03b53ec6c862353705d6d","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","c5fadeb5d90d68baffc631455a07ca340ccf1e31110955e16d45eb5f87147cd9","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","4918eb332a41b71ba9a74b1dc64276cfff592e55107b93baae38af3520e55975","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","6b1b35c6dee48851bac53a4494ca8f819503be00212dbceb899dc03acd7641db","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","32e1827635450ebb3c5a7d12c1f8e7b2b514439ac10a67eef3d9fd9c5c68e245","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","84de35e2584d2b144aae823c9ed0b0f3deda09648530b93d1a2a146d1dea9864","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","7d4e04503ab26615dd5f29ec08b52943cbe5f17bacc3012b26220caa232ab14c","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","5e5fc1434c928bcdcba6f801859d5238341093291980fd36e33b7416393d5a2c","wss://purplepag.es","93"],["zap","1237fba45b7df77b4cca2209dc68d208a4fa7384cce03b53ec6c862353705d6d","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","c5fadeb5d90d68baffc631455a07ca340ccf1e31110955e16d45eb5f87147cd9","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","4918eb332a41b71ba9a74b1dc64276cfff592e55107b93baae38af3520e55975","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","6b1b35c6dee48851bac53a4494ca8f819503be00212dbceb899dc03acd7641db","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","32e1827635450ebb3c5a7d12c1f8e7b2b514439ac10a67eef3d9fd9c5c68e245","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","84de35e2584d2b144aae823c9ed0b0f3deda09648530b93d1a2a146d1dea9864","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["zap","7d4e04503ab26615dd5f29ec08b52943cbe5f17bacc3012b26220caa232ab14c","wss://purplepag.es","1"],["published_at","1731998950"]],"content":"## How to READ - JOIN - POST \nin nostr web-based real time group chat -\u003e  chachi.chat  \nDummies 101 guide\n\n\n1.

手順\n\n1. 登録する画像を用意する\n2. 画像をweb上にアップロードする\n3. 絵文字セットに登録する\n\n\n\n## 1. 登録する画像を用意する\n\n以下のような方法で用意してください。\n\n* 画像編集ソフト等を使って自分で作成する\n* 絵文字作成サイトを使う（[絵文字ジェネレーター](https://emoji-gen.ninja/)、[MEGAMOJI](https://zk-phi.github.io/MEGAMOJI/) など）\n* フリー画像を使う（[いらすとや](https://www.irasutoya.com/) など）\n\n### データ量削減\n\nNostrでは画像をそのまま表示するクライアントが多いので、データ量が大きな画像をそのまま使うとモバイル通信時などに負担がかかります。\n\nデータ量を増やさないためにサイズやファイル形式を変更することをおすすめします。\n\n以下は私のおすすめです。\n* サイズ：正方形 128×128 ピクセル、長方形 任意の横幅×128 ピクセル\n* ファイル形式：webp形式（webp変換おすすめサイト [toimg](https://toimg.kakechimaru.com/to-webp)）\n  * 単色、単純な画像の場合：png形式（webpにするとむしろサイズが大きくなる）\n\n### その他\n\n* 背景透過画像\n* ダークモード、ライトモード両方で見やすい色\n\nがおすすめです。\n\n## 2. 画像をweb上にアップロードする\n\nよく分からなければ [emojito](https://emojito.meme/) からのアップロードで問題ないです。  \n普段使っている画像アップロード先があるならそれでも構いません。  \n気になる方はアップロード先を適宜選んでください。  \n\n既に投稿されたカスタム絵文字の画像に対して  \n\n- 削除も差し替えもできない → [emojito](https://emojito.meme/) など  \n- 削除できるが差し替えはできない → [Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/)、[nostrcheck.me](https://nostrcheck.me/)など  \n- 削除も差し替えもできる → [GitHub](https://github.com/) 、セルフホスティングなど  \n\nこれらは既にNostr上に投稿されたカスタム絵文字の画像を後から変更できるかどうかを指します。  \nどの方法でも新しく使われるカスタム絵文字を変更することは可能です。  \n同一のカスタム絵文字セットに同一のショートコードで別の画像を登録する形で対応できます。\n\n## 3. 絵文字セットに登録する\n\n[emojito](https://emojito.meme/) から登録します。\n\n右上の**アイコン** → **+ New emoji set** から新規の絵文字セットを作成できます。\n![image](https://nostrcheck.me/media/lokuyow/6e9aa6555dd29b613fc0526cca93b990b4ca20865b3887e282c47f30d56ee1c6.webp)\n\n![image](https://nostrcheck.me/media/lokuyow/926b460d64b50215a0dc95e5fe38facce5d723ad0d54115f5279aa10f225d5d3.webp)\n\n#### ① 絵文字セット名を入力\n\n基本的にカスタム絵文字はカスタム絵文字セットを作り、ひとまとまりにして登録します。\n\n一度作った絵文字セットに後から絵文字を追加することもできます。\n\n#### ② 画像をアップロードまたは画像URLを入力\n\nemojitoから画像をアップロードする場合、ファイル名に日本語などの2バイト文字が含まれているとアップロードがエラーになるようです。\n\nその場合はファイル名を適当な英数字などに変更してください。\n\n#### ③ 絵文字のショートコードを入力\n\nショートコードは絵文字を呼び出す時に使用する場合があります。\n\n他のカスタム絵文字と被っても問題ありませんが選択時に複数表示されて支障が出る可能性があります。\n\n他と被りにくく長くなりすぎないショートコードが良いかもしれません。\n\nショートコードに使えるのは半角の英数字とアンダーバーのみです。\n\n#### ④ 追加\n\n**Add** を押してもまだ作成完了にはなりません。\n\n![image](https://nostrcheck.me/media/lokuyow/ff9cbd28825ba38aa71cca686fcb933f4e87b55ba4d33687f896b668f0dd1fe2.webp)\n\n一度に絵文字を複数登録できます。\n\n最後に右上の **Save** を押すと作成完了です。\n\n![image](https://nostrcheck.me/media/lokuyow/c6783b066c48304e066d0a0939bdf5e613f8970dd570615221f8e5044dbea45b.webp)\n\n画面が切り替わるので、右側の **Options** から **Bookmark** を選択するとそのカスタム絵文字セットを自分で使えるようになります。\n\n既存の絵文字セットを編集するには **Options** から **Edit** を選択します。\n\n以上です。\n\n-----------\n\n# 仕様\n\n[NIP-30 Custom

[my Soapminer article](https://habla.news/u/marc@primal.net/washing-the-invisible-hand-with-soapminer), I added quotes from various plebs. I earned over 12,000 sats! That's enough for a McJunk today, but maybe a steak dinner in a few years. That's my two sats anyway.\n\n*This is not investment advice*\n\nIt feels great to receive value from people who support and appreciate your work. It's also nice to stack more sats by writing. I have a budget of $25.00  that I have sent to various people using Zapplanner, but I'm trying something new: Zapsplits. \n\n## WTF Are  Zapsplits?\n\nI asked [Unleashed.chat](https://unleashed.chat). Here's what the anthropomorphic Unleashed said.\n\nMe:\nWhat is a Zapsplit on nostr?\n\n![unleashed](https://unleashed.chat/_app/immutable/assets/logo-small.anXFAtno.jpeg)\n\nUnleashed:\n\nA Zapsplit on Nostr refers to splitting a Zap, which is a form of donation or tipping on the ~platform~ protocol, among multiple recipients. **It allows users to distribute their support more broadly across various content creators instead of just one**.\n\nThat's more succinct than I would put it, but nostr is a protocol, not a platform. The important part about  Zapsplits for me is that it removes the cognitive cost of deciding what percentage of my giving budget should go to each creator. Do I zap podcast guests? Do podcasters with ads get less than podcasters sans ads? How much value did this particular article bring me? If I zap Guy Swann, should I also zap the authors he reads? Should I zap long-form articles more than micro-blogs? There are 21 million different considerations.\n\n\n Zapsplits removes all this from me because I can use the following algorithm.\n\n![v4V](https://gitea.marc26z.com/marc/Marc26z/raw/commit/9dfee3d0ce70c8f8a039abc333bd5247979a771a/zapsplits/Screenshot%20from%202025-02-26%2007-15-19.png)\n### Does This Person Provide Me Value? \n\nYes ⬇️\n\nI add them to my Zapsplit post for that month. A portion of my monthly zapping budget, 25 dirty-fiat bucks, transforms into magic Internet money and is distributed among everyone in the Zapsplit.\n\nNo ⬇️\nIf I don't get any value, I don't send value. Simple.\n\n\n#### Testing  Zapsplits\n\nI added podcasters and devs to a nostr post and enabled a 10-way zapsplit on the post.  It's based on [prisms](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/lightning-prism-nostr/), a little nostr feature that gives me prose writing superpowers. \n\n1. I can earn sats for writing.\n2. I can support others with a single zap.\n3. I can add people who give me quotes to my zap splits.\n   \nPeople appreciate attribution. I suspect they will appreciate it more if they also get paid. What if I added some quotes to an article and then split any zaps I get with the quoted plebs? Come to think of it, I'll try it. [Here's a quote from a dev on nostr](nostr:note1qf4277rudtflllrjr555890xsjp6u60f7xdvclkwc9t220duajeq0x665q\n\n\nI added Silberangel to the  Zapsplits on Habla.news.\n\n\nMy [V4V](https://blog.getalby.com/the-case-for-value-4-value/) payments can also get sent to ten different plebs with a simple click of a button. I am going to start using this for a lot of my monthly V4V budget. Every month, I'll think about the people's content I value most and add them to a single zapsplit payment. Then, I'll zap the post.\n\nSay I create a poll and make a wager with ten different people. If I lose, I can pay everyone pit at the same time. This is probably better for a football pool, but you get the idea. The options are limited only by your imagination.\n\n![zapsplit example](https://gitea.marc26z.com/marc/Marc26z/raw/commit/04c5a6ade17c12265e651bbc1524f5d5a167e9ff/zapsplits/download.jpeg)\n\nnostr:nevent1qqspnhucgxc6mprhw36fe2242hzv7zumavyy7dhzjswtldhxk4dh7ugpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsygxlg7zks3uauf454q7phhzdh2mpkhxg9cdrzt3t9z7gzksj49g7vupsgqqqqqqsl5uwfl\n\nOther people can also zap the post. As Siberangel says, we can use other people's money to provide value, too. This is a great option for stacking neophytes, people who don't have much bitcoin or cheap skates. Let's be honest, bitcoin has made most of us cheapskates.\n\nBitcoin books with multiple authors can have QR codes that link to one of these Zapsplit posts. The authors can do a book signing and sell their books using this on nostr. Nerds like me can get three autographs and zap the book. The sats are split among all authors. Here's a Zapsplit that includes all the authors of Parallel.\n\n![parallell](https://gitea.marc26z.com/marc/Marc26z/raw/commit/301363f17362a786af8a4e24f124c806278704c1/zapsplits/Screenshot%20from%202025-02-26%2017-54-31.png)\n\n\nCan you think of any other ways to use  Zapsplits?

Because it is a protocol it is not controlled by any one company, does not reside on any one set of servers, does not require any licenses, and no one can stop you from using it however you like. \n\nWhen the name Nostr is recognised, it is as a \"Twitter/X alternative\" – that is an online open public forum. Nostr is more than just this. The open nature of the protocol means that you can use it however you feel like, including that you can use it for creating your own social websites to suit whatever goals you have – anything from running your own team collaboration app, to running your own online community.\n\nNostr can be anything – not just an alternative to X, but also to Slack, Teams, Discord, Telegram (etc) – any kind of social app you'd like to run for your users can be run on Nostr.\n\nIn this blog I will show you how to launch your own community website, for your community members to use however they like, with low code, and for free.\n\n#### Simple useful components\n\nNostr has a few simple components that work together to provide your experience –\n\n- **Your \"client\"** – an app or a website front-end that you log into, which displays the content you want to see\n- **Your \"relay\"** – a server back-end which receives and stores content, and sends it to clients\n- **Your \"user\"** – a set of keys which represents a user on the network,\n- **Your \"content\"** – any user content created and signed by a user, distributed to any relay, which can be picked up and viewed by any client.\n\nIt is a pattern that is used by every other social app on the internet, excepting that in those cases you can usually only view content in their app, and only post your content to their server.\n\nVs with Nostr where you can use any client (app) and any relay (server), including your own.\n\nThis is defined as a standard in [NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md) which is simple enough that you can master it in a weekend, and with which you can build any kind of application.\n\nThe design space is wide open for anyone to build anything–\n\n- Clones of [Twitter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitorpamplona.amethyst), [Instagram](https://olas.app/), [Telegram](https://0xchat.com/), [Medium](https://habla.news/), [Twitch](https://zap.stream/), etc,\n- Whole new things like [Private Ephemeral Messengers](http://shh.com), [Social Podcasting Apps](https://www.fountain.fm/), etc,\n- Anything else you can dream up, like replacements for B2B SaaS or ERP systems.\n\nIncluding that you can set up and run your own \"X\" for your community.\n\n#### Super powers for –private– social internet\n\nWhen considering my use of social internet, it is foremost private not public. Email, Whatsapp, Slack, Teams, Discord, Telegram (etc), are all about me, as a user, creating content for a selected group of individuals – close friends, colleagues, community members – not the wider public.\n\nThis private social internet is crying out for the kind of powers that Nostr provides. The list of things that Nostr solves for private social internet goes on-and-on. \n\nLet me eat my own dog food for a moment.\n\n- **I am a member of a community of technology entrepreneurs** with an app for internal community comms. The interface is not fit for this purpose. Good content gets lost. Any content created within the walled kingdom cannot be shared externally. Community members cannot migrate to a different front-end, or cross-post to public social channels.\n- **I am a member of many communities for kids social groups**, each one with a different application and log in. There is no way to view a consolidated feed. There is no way to send one message to many communities, or share content between them. Remembering to check every feed separately is a drag.\n- **I am a member of a team with an app for team comms**. It costs $XXX per user per month where it should be free. I can't self-host. I can't control or export my data. I can't make it interoperate natively with other SaaS. All of my messages probably go to train a Big Co AI without my consent.\n\nIn each instance \"Nostr fixes this.\"\n\n#### Ready now for low-code admins\n\nTo date Nostr has been best suited to a more technical user. To use the Nostr protocol directly has been primarily a field of great engineers building great foundations.\n\nIMO these foundations are built. They are open source, free to use, and accessible for anyone who wants to create an administer their own online community, with only low code required.\n\nTo prove it, in this blog I will scratch my own itch. I need a X / Slack / Teams alternative to use with a few team members and friends (and a few AIs) as we hack on establishing a new business idea.\n\nI will set this up with Nostr using only open source code, for free.\n\n### Designing the Solution\n\nI am mostly non-technical with helpful AI. To set up your own community website in the style of X / Slack / Teams should be possible for anyone with basic technology skills.\n\n- I have a cheap VPS which currently runs some [other](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/4f0baffd/) [unrelated](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/8ca68889/) [Nostr projects](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/setting-up-payments-on-nostr-7o6ls7/) in Docker containers,\n- My objective was to set up and run my own community website for my own team use, in Docker, hosted on my own server.\n\n#### User requirements\n\nWhat will I want from a community website?\n\n- I want my users to be able to log into a website and post content,\n- I want to save that content to a server I control accessed only be people I authorise,\n- I want my users to view only that content by default, and not be exposed to any wider public social network unless they knowingly select that,\n- I want my user's content to be either:\n  - a) viewable only by other community members (i.e. for internal team comms), or \n  - b) by the wider public (i.e. for public announcements), at the user's discretion.\n- I want it to be open source so that other people maintain the code for me,\n- I want it for free.\n\n#### Nostr solutions\n\nTo achieve this with Nostr, I'll need to select some solutions \"a-la carte\" for each of the core components of the network.\n\n- **A client –** For my client, I have chosen Jumble. Jumble is a free open-source client by [Cody Tseng](nostr:npub1syjmjy0dp62dhccq3g97fr87tngvpvzey08llyt6ul58m2zqpzps9wf6wl), available free on [Github](https://github.com/CodyTseng/jumble) or at [Jumble.social](https://jumble.social/). I have chosen Jumble because it is a \"relay-centric\" client. In key spots the user interface highlights for the user what relay they are viewing, and what relay they are posting to. As a result, it is a beautiful fit for me to use as the home of all my community content.\n- **A relay –** For my relay, I have chosen [Simple With Whitelist (SW2)](https://github.com/bitvora/sw2). SW2 is a free open-source relay by [Utxo The Webmaster](nostr:npub1utx00neqgqln72j22kej3ux7803c2k986henvvha4thuwfkper4s7r50e8), based on [Khatru](https://khatru.nostr.technology/) by [Fiatjaf](nostr:npub180cvv07tjdrrgpa0j7j7tmnyl2yr6yr7l8j4s3evf6u64th6gkwsyjh6w6), available free on [Github](https://github.com/bitvora/sw2). I have chosen SW2 because it allows for very simple configuration of user auth. Users can be given read access to view notes, and write access to post notes within simple `config.json` files. This allows you to keep community content private or selectively share it in a variety of ways. Per the Nostr protocol, your client will connect with your relay via websocket.\n- **A user sign-up flow –** Jumble has a user sign-up flow using Nstart by Fiatjaf, or as an admin I can create and provision my own users with any simple tool like [NAK](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak) or [Nostrtool](https://nostrtool.com/).\n- **A user content flow –** Jumble has a user content flow that can post notes to selected relays of the users choice. Rich media is uploaded to free third-party hosts like [Nostr.build](https://nostr.build/), and in the future there is scope to self-host this too.\n\nWith each of these boxes ticked I'm ready to start.\n\n### Launching a Private Community Website with Jumble and SW2\n\n#### Install your SW2 relay\n\nThe relay is the trickiest part, so let's start there. SW2 is my Nostr relay software of choice. It is a Go application and includes full instructions for Go install. However, I prefer Docker, so I have built a Docker version and maintain a [Docker branch here](https://github.com/r0d8lsh0p/sw2/tree/docker).\n\n**1 – In a terminal clone the repo and checkout the Docker branch**\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/r0d8lsh0p/sw2.git\ncd sw2\ngit checkout docker\n```\n\n**2 – Set up the environment variables**\n\nThese are specified in the readme. Duplicate the example .env file and fill it with your variables.\n\n```\ncp .env.example .env \n```\n\nFor me this .env file was as follows–\n\n```\n# Relay Metadata\nRELAY_NAME=\"Tbdai relay\"\nRELAY_PUBKEY=\"ede41352397758154514148b24112308ced96d121229b0e6a66bc5a2b40c03ec\"\nRELAY_DESCRIPTION=\"An experimental relay for some people and robots working on a TBD AI project.\"\nRELAY_URL=\"wss://assistantrelay.rodbishop.nz\"\nRELAY_ICON=\"https://image.nostr.build/44654201843fc0f03e9a72fbf8044143c66f0dd4d5350688db69345f9da05007.jpg\"\nRELAY_CONTACT=\"https://rodbishop.nz\"\n```\n\n**3 – Specify who can read and write to the relay**\n\nThis is controlled by two config files `read_whitelist.json` and `write_whitelist.json`.\n\n- Any user with their pubkey in the `read_whitelist` can read notes posted to the relay. If empty, anyone can read.\n- Any user with their pubkey in the `write_whitelist` can post notes to the relay. If empty, anyone can write.\n\nWe'll get to creating and authorising more users later, for now I suggest to add yourself to each whitelist, by copying your pubkey into each JSON file. For me this looks as follows (note, I use the 'hex' version of the pubkey, rather than the npub)–\n\n```\n{\n  \"pubkeys\": [\n    \"1bda7e1f7396bda2d1ef99033da8fd2dc362810790df9be62f591038bb97c4d9\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n*If this is your first time using Nostr and you don't yet have any user keys, it is easy and free to get one. You can get one from any Nostr client like [Jumble.social](http://Jumble.social), any tool like [NAK](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak) or [nostrtool.com](https://nostrtool.com/) or follow a comprehensive guide like my [guide on mining a Nostr key](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/mining-your-vanity-pubkey-4iupbf/).*\n\n**4 – Launch your relay**\n\nIf you are using my Docker fork from above, then–\n\n```\ndocker compose up\n```\n\nYour relay should now be running on port 3334 and ready to accept web socket connections from your client.\n\nBefore you move on to set up the client, it's helpful to quickly test that it is running as expected.\n\n**5 – Test your websocket connection**\n\nFor this I use a tool called wscat to make a websocket connection.\n\nYou may need to install wscat, e.g.\n\n```\nnpm install -g wscat\n```\n\nAnd then run it, e.g.\n\n```\nwscat -c ws://localhost:3334\n```\n\n(note use `ws://` for localhost, rather than `wss://`).\n\nIf your relay is working successfully then it should receive your websocket connection request and respond with an AUTH token, asking you to identify yourself as a user in the relay's `read_whitelist.json` (using the standard outlined in [NIP-42](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/42.md)), e.g.\n\n```\nConnected (press CTRL+C to quit)\n\u003c [\"AUTH\",\"13206fea43ef2952\"]\n\n\u003e\n```\n\nYou do not need to authorise for now.\n\nIf you received this kind of message, your relay is working successfully.\n\n#### Set a subdomain for your relay\n\nLet's connect a domain name so your community members can access your relay.\n\n**1 – Configure DNS**\n\nAt a high level –\n\n1. Get your domain (buy one if you need to)\n2. Get the IP address of your VPS\n3. In your domain's DNS settings add those records as an A record to the subdomain of your choice, e.g. `relay` as in `relay.your_domain_name.com`, or in my case `assistantrelay.rodbishop.nz`\n\nYour subdomain now points to your server.\n\n**2 – Configure reverse proxy**\n\nYou need to redirect traffic from your subdomain to your relay at port `3334`.\n\nOn my VPS I use Caddy as a reverse proxy for a few projects, I have it sitting in a separate Docker network. To use it for my SW2 Relay required two steps.\n\n First – I added configuration to Caddy's `Caddyfile` to tell it what to do with requests for the `relay.your_domain_name.com` subdomain. For me this looked like–\n\n```\nassistantrelay.rodbishop.nz {\n  reverse_proxy sw2-relay:3334 {\n    # Enable WebSocket support\n    header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote}\n    header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}\n    header_up X-Forwarded-Port {server_port}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n Second – I added the Caddy Docker network to the SW2 `docker-compose.yml` to make it be part of the Caddy network. In my Docker branch, I provide this commented section which you can uncomment and use if you like.\n\n```\nservices:\n  relay:\n     ... relay configuration here ...\n#    networks:\n#      - caddy # Connect to a Caddy network for reverse proxy\n\n# networks:\n#  caddy:\n#    external: true # Connect to a Caddy network for reverse proxy\n```\n\nYour relay is now running at your domain name.\n\n#### Run Jumble.social\n\nYour client set up is very easy, as most heavy lifting is done by your relay. My client of choice is Jumble because it has features that focus the user experience on the community's content first. You have two options for running Jumble.\n\n1. Run your own local copy of Jumble by cloning the Github (optional)\n2. Use the public instance at Jumble.social (easier, and what we'll do in this demo)\n\nIf you (optionally) want to run your own local copy of Jumble:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/CodyTseng/jumble.git\ncd jumble\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nFor this demo, I will just use the public instance at [http://jumble.social](http://jumble.social)\n\nJumble has a very helpful user interface for set up and configuration. But, I wanted to think ahead to onboarding community members, and so instead I will do some work up front in order to give new members a smooth onboarding flow that I would suggest for an administrator to use in onboarding their community.\n\n**1 – Create a custom landing page URL for your community members to land on**\n\nWhen your users come to your website for the first time, you want them to get your community experience without any distraction. That will either be–\n\n1. A prompt to sign up or login (if only authorised users can read content)\n2. The actual content from your other community members (If all users can read content)\n\nYour landing page URL will look like: `http://jumble.social/?r=wss://relay.your_domain_name.com`\n\n- `http://jumble.social/` – the URL of the Jumble instance you are using\n- `?r=` – telling Jumble to read from a relay\n- `wss://` – relays connect via websocket using wss, rather than https\n- `relay.your_domain_name.com` – the domain name of your relay\n\nFor me, this URL looks like `http://jumble.social/?r=wss://assistantrelay.rodbishop.nz`\n\n**2 – Visit your custom Jumble URL**\n\nThis should load the landing page of your relay on Jumble. \n\nIn the background, Jumble has attempted to establish a websocket connection to your relay.\n\nIf your relay is configured with read authentication, it has sent a challenge to Jumble asking your user to authenticate. Jumble, accordingly should now be showing you a login screen, asking your user to login.\n\n**3 – Login or Sign Up**\n\nYou will see a variety of sign up and login options. To test, log in with the private key that you have configured to have read and write access.\n\nIn the background, Jumble has connected via websocket to your relay, checked that your user is authorised to view notes, and if so, has returned all the content on the relay. (If this is your first time here, there would not be any content yet). \n\nIf you give this link to your users to use as their landing page, they will land, login, and see only notes from members of your community.\n\n**4– Make your first post to your community**\n\nClick the \"post\" button and post a note. Jumble offers you the option to \"Send only to relay.your_domain_name.com\".\n\n- **If set to on**, then Jumble will post the note only to your relay, no others. It will also include a specific tag (the `\"-\"` tag) which requests relays to not forward the note across the network. Only your community members viewing notes on your community relay can see it.\n- **If set to off**, then Jumble will post the note to your relay and also the wider public Nostr network. Community members viewing notes on the relay can see it, and so can any user of the wider Nostr network.\n\n**5– Optional, configure your relay sets**\n\nAt the top of the screen you should now see a dropdown with the URL of your relay.\n\nEach user can save this relay to a \"relay set\" for future use, and also view, add or delete other relays sets including some sets which Jumble comes with set up by default.\n\nAs an admin you can use this to give users access to multiple relays. And, as a user, you can use this to access posts from multiple different community relays, all within the one client.\n\n#### Your community website is up and running\n\nThat is the basic set up completed.\n\n- You have a website where your community members can visit a URL to post notes and view all notes from all other members of the community.\n- You have basic administration to enforce your own read and write permissions very simply in two json files.\n\nLet's check in with my user requirements as a community admin–\n\n- My community is saving content to a server where I control access\n- My users view only that content by default, and are not exposed to any wider public social network unless they knowingly select that\n- My user's content is a) viewable only by other community members, or b) by the wider public, at the user's discretion\n- Other people are maintaining the code for me\n- It's free\n\nThis setup has scope to solve my dog fooding issues from earlier–\n\n- If adopted, my tech community can iterate the interface to suit its needs, find great content, and share content beyond the community.\n- If adopted, my kids social groups can each have their own relays, but I can post to all of them together, or view a consolidated feed.\n- If adopted, my team can chat with each other for free. I can self host this. It can natively interoperate with any other Nostr SaaS. It would be entirely private and will not be captured to train a Big Co AI without my consent.\n\n#### Using your community website in practice\n\n**An example onboarding flow**\n\n1. A new member joins your IRL community\n2. Your admin person gives them your landing page URL where they can view all the posts by your community members – If you have configured your relay to have no read auth required, then they can land on that landing page and immediately start viewing your community's posts, a great landing experience\n3. The user user creates a Nostr profile, and provides the admin person with their public key\n4. The admin person adds their key to the whitelists to read and write as you desire.\n\n**Default inter-op with the wider Nostr network**\n\n- If you change your mind on SW2 and want to use a different relay, your notes will be supported natively, and you can migrate on your own terms\n- If you change your mind on Jumble and want to use a different client, your relay will be supported natively, and you can migrate on your own terms\n- If you want to add other apps to your community's experience, every Nostr app will interoperate with your community by default – see the huge list at [Awesome Nostr](https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr)\n- If any of your users want to view your community notes inside some other Nostr client – perhaps to see a consolidated feed of notes from all their different communities – they can.\n\nFor me, I use Amethyst app as my main Nostr client to view the public posts from people I follow. I have added my private community relay to Amethyst, and now my community posts appear alongside all these other posts in a single consolidated feed.\n\n**Scope to further improve**\n\n- You can run multiple different relays with different user access – e.g. one for wider company and one for your team\n- You can run your own fork of Jumble and change the interface to suit you needs – e.g. add your logo, change the colours, link to other resources from the sidebar.\n\n**Other ideas for running communities**\n\n- **Guest accounts**: You can give a user \"guest\" access – read auth, but no write auth – to help people see the value of your community before becoming members.\n- **Running a knowledge base**: You can whitelist users to read notes, but only administrators can post notes.\n- **Running a blind dropbox**: You can whitelist users to post notes, but only the administrator can read notes.\n- **Running on a local terminal only:** With Jumble and SW2 installed on a machine, running at – `localhost:5173` for Jumble, and `localhost:3334` for SW2 you can have an entirely local experience at `http://localhost:5173/?r=ws://localhost:3334`.\n\n### What's Next?\n\nIn my first four blogs I explored creating a good Nostr setup with [Vanity Npub](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/mining-your-vanity-pubkey-4iupbf/), [Lightning Payments](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/setting-up-payments-on-nostr-7o6ls7/), [Nostr Addresses at Your Domain](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/ee8a46bc/), and [Personal Nostr Relay](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/8ca68889/).\n\nThen in my latest three blogs I explored different types of interoperability [with NFC cards](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/edde8387/), [n8n Workflow Automation](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/4f0baffd/), and now running a private community website on Nostr.\n\nFor this community website–\n\n- There is scope to make some further enhancements to SW2, including to add a \"Blossom\" media server so that community admins can self-host their own rich media, and to create an admin screen for administration of the whitelists using [NIP-86](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/86.md).\n- There is scope to explore all other kinds of Nostr clients to form the front-end of community websites, including Chachi.chat, Flotilla, and others.\n- Nostr includes a whole variety of different optional standards for making more elaborate online communities including [NIP-28](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/28.md), [NIP-29](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md), [NIP-17](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/17.md), [NIP-72](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/72.md) (etc). Each gives certain different capabilities, and I haven't used any of them! For this simple demo they are not required, but each could be used to extend the capabilities of the admin and community.\n\nI am also doing a lot of work with AI on Nostr, including that I use my private community website as a front-end for engaging with a Nostr AI. I'll post about this soon too.\n\nPlease be sure to let me know if you think there's another Nostr topic you'd like to see me tackle.\n\nGM Nostr.","sig":"beb291f127c73a9e86fa9ee02288a681d7f4aee150d6733c4add0dc9a545196331697a72843ccc2223809779d0771dfe73fb6d172e12e82ceabdf1e933fb37b1"},"naddr1qqyrge3svfskvenyqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qr0d8u8mnj6769500nypnm28a9hpk9qg8jr0ehe30tygr3wuhcnvsxpqqqp65wtk0der":{"kind":30023,"id":"1016481f52d8c76550968ea67fb8dc1745996d8d4dd37d3c030a0e0f8147fcdc","pubkey":"1bda7e1f7396bda2d1ef99033da8fd2dc362810790df9be62f591038bb97c4d9","created_at":1735795148,"tags":[["d","4f0baffd"],["title","Workflow Automation for Nostr"],["summary","How to use workflow automation with Nostr, using n8n and Nostrobots, to delegate account access, set up push notifications, and more."],["published_at","1735794665"],["t","nostr"],["t","grownostr"],["t","n8n"],["image","https://m.primal.net/NObR.png"],["published_at","1735794665"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqx760c0h894a5tg7lxgr8k506twrv2qs0yxln0nz7kgs8zae03xeqqyrge3svfskvenyp9vgvd"],["p","26bb2ebed6c552d670c804b0d655267b3c662b21e026d6e48ac93a6070530958"],["p","eab0e756d32b80bcd464f3d844b8040303075a13eabc3599a762c9ac7ab91f4f"],["p","683211bd155c7b764e4b99ba263a151d81209be7a566a2bb1971dc1bbd3b715e"],["t","creating"]],"content":"### Tldr\n\n- Nostr is an open and interoperable protocol\n- You can integrate it with workflow automation tools to augment your experience\n- n8n is a great low/no-code workflow automation tool which you can host yourself\n- Nostrobots allows you to integrate Nostr into n8n\n- In this blog I create some workflow automations for Nostr\n- A simple form to delegate posting notes\n- Push notifications for mentions on multiple accounts\n- Push notifications for your favourite accounts when they post a note\n- All workflows are provided as open source with MIT license for you to use\n\n### Inter-op All The Things\n\nNostr is a new open social protocol for the internet. This open nature exciting because of the opportunities for interoperability with other technologies. In [Using NFC Cards with Nostr]() I explored the `nostr:` URI to launch Nostr clients from a card tap.\n\nThe interoperability of Nostr doesn't stop there. The internet has many super-powers, and Nostr is open to all of them. Simply, there's no one to stop it. There is no one in charge, there are no permissioned APIs, and there are no risks of being de-platformed. If you can imagine technologies that would work well with Nostr, then any and all of them can ride on or alongside Nostr rails.\n\nMy mental model for why this is special is Google Wave ~2010. Google Wave was to be the next big platform. Lars was running it and had a big track record from Maps. I was excited for it. Then, Google pulled the plug. And, immediately all the time and capital invested in understanding and building on the platform was wasted. \n\nThis cannot happen to Nostr, as there is no one to pull the plug, and maybe even no plug to pull. \n\nSo long as users demand Nostr, Nostr will exist, and that is a pretty strong guarantee. It makes it worthwhile to invest in bringing Nostr into our other applications.\n\nAll we need are simple ways to plug things together.\n\n### Nostr and Workflow Automation\n\nWorkflow automation is about helping people to streamline their work. As a user, the most common way I achieve this is by connecting disparate systems together. By setting up one system to trigger another or to move data between systems, I can solve for many different problems and become way more effective.\n\n#### n8n for workflow automation\n\nMany workflow automation tools exist. My favourite is [n8n](https://n8n.io/). n8n is a low/no-code workflow automation platform which allows you to build all kinds of workflows. You can use it for free, you can self-host it, it has a user-friendly UI and useful API. Vs Zapier it can be far more elaborate. Vs Make.com I find it to be more intuitive in how it abstracts away the right parts of the code, but still allows you to code when you need to.\n\nMost importantly you can plug anything into n8n: You have built-in nodes for specific applications. HTTP nodes for any other API-based service. And community nodes built by individual community members for any other purpose you can imagine.\n\n#### Eating my own dogfood\n\nIt's very clear to me that there is a big design space here just demanding to be explored. If you could integrate Nostr with anything, what would you do?\n\nIn my view the best way for anyone to start anything is by solving their own problem first (aka \"scratching your own itch\" and \"eating your own dogfood\"). As I get deeper into Nostr I find myself controlling multiple Npubs – to date I have a personal Npub, a brand Npub for a community I am helping, an AI assistant Npub, and various testing Npubs. I need ways to delegate access to those Npubs without handing over the keys, ways to know if they're mentioned, and ways to know if they're posting.\n\nI can build workflows with n8n to solve these issues for myself to start with, and keep expanding from there as new needs come up.\n\n### Running n8n with Nostrobots\n\nI am mostly non-technical with a very helpful AI. To set up n8n to work with Nostr and operate these workflows should be possible for anyone with basic technology skills.\n\n- I have a cheap VPS which currently runs my [HAVEN Nostr Relay](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/8ca68889/) and [Albyhub Lightning Node](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/setting-up-payments-on-nostr-7o6ls7/) in Docker containers,\n- My objective was to set up n8n to run alongside these in a separate Docker container on the same server, install the required nodes, and then build and host my workflows. \n\n#### Installing n8n\n\nSelf-hosting n8n could not be easier. I followed n8n's [Docker-Compose installation docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/server-setups/docker-compose/)–\n\n- Install Docker and Docker-Compose if you haven't already,\n- Create your ``docker-compose.yml`` and `.env` files from the docs,\n- Create your data folder `sudo docker volume create n8n_data`,\n- Start your container with `sudo docker compose up -d`,\n- Your n8n instance should be online at port `5678`.\n\nn8n is free to self-host but does require a license. Enter your credentials into n8n to get your free license key. You should now have access to the Workflow dashboard and can create and host any kind of workflows from there.\n\n#### Installing Nostrobots\n\nTo integrate n8n nicely with Nostr, I used the [Nostrobots](https://github.com/ocknamo/n8n-nodes-nostrobots?tab=readme-ov-file) community node by [Ocknamo](nostr:npub1y6aja0kkc4fdvuxgqjcdv4fx0v7xv2epuqnddey2eyaxquznp9vq0tp75l).\n\nIn n8n parlance a \"node\" enables certain functionality as a step in a workflow e.g. a \"set\" node sets a variable, a \"send email\" node sends an email. n8n comes with all kinds of \"official\" nodes installed by default, and Nostr is not amongst them. However, n8n also comes with a framework for community members to create their own \"community\" nodes, which is where Nostrobots comes in. \n\nYou can only use a community node in a self-hosted n8n instance (which is what you have if you are running in Docker on your own server, but this limitation does prevent you from using n8n's own hosted alternative).\n\nTo install a community node, [see n8n community node docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/gui-install/). From your workflow dashboard–\n\n- Click the \"...\" in the bottom left corner beside your username, and click \"settings\",\n- Cilck \"community nodes\" left sidebar,\n- Click \"Install\",\n- Enter the \"npm Package Name\" which is `n8n-nodes-nostrobots`,\n- Accept the risks and click \"Install\",\n- Nostrobots is now added to your n8n instance.\n\n#### Using Nostrobots\n\nNostrobots gives you nodes to help you build Nostr-integrated workflows–\n\n- **Nostr Write** – for posting Notes to the Nostr network,\n- **Nostr Read** – for reading Notes from the Nostr network, and\n- **Nostr Utils** – for performing certain conversions you may need (e.g. from bech32 to hex).\n\nNostrobots has [good documentation](https://github.com/ocknamo/n8n-nodes-nostrobots?tab=readme-ov-file) on each node which focuses on simple use cases. \n\nEach node has a \"convenience mode\" by default. For example, the \"Read\" Node by default will fetch Kind 1 notes by a simple filter, in Nostrobots parlance a \"Strategy\". For example, with Strategy set to \"Mention\" the node will accept a pubkey and fetch all Kind 1 notes that Mention the pubkey within a time period. This is very good for quick use.\n\nWhat wasn't clear to me initially (until Ocknamo helped me out) is that advanced use cases are also possible.\n\nEach node also has an advanced mode. For example, the \"Read\" Node can have \"Strategy\" set to \"RawFilter(advanced)\". Now the node will accept json (anything you like that complies with [NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md)). You can use this to query Notes (Kind 1) as above, and also Profiles (Kind 0), Follow Lists (Kind 3), Reactions (Kind 7), Zaps (Kind 9734/9735), and anything else you can think of.\n\n#### Creating and adding workflows\n\nWith n8n and Nostrobots installed, you can now create or add any kind of Nostr Workflow Automation.\n\n- Click \"Add workflow\" to go to the workflow builder screen,\n- If you would like to build your own workflow, you can start with adding any node. Click \"+\" and see what is available. Type \"Nostr\" to explore the Nostrobots nodes you have added,\n- If you would like to add workflows that someone else has built, click \"...\" in the top right. Then click \"import from URL\" and paste in the URL of any workflow you would like to use (including the ones I share later in this article).\n\n### Nostr Workflow Automations\n\nIt's time to build some things!\n\n#### A simple form to post a note to Nostr\n\nI started very simply. I needed to delegate the ability to post to Npubs that I own in order that a (future) team can test things for me. I don't want to worry about managing or training those people on how to use keys, and I want to revoke access easily.\n\nI needed a basic form with credentials that posted a Note. \n\nFor this I can use a very simple workflow–\n\n- **A n8n Form node** – Creates a form for users to enter the note they wish to post. Allows for the form to be protected by a username and password. This node is the workflow \"trigger\" so that the workflow runs each time the form is submitted.\n- **A Set node** – Allows me to set some variables, in this case I set the relays that I intend to use. I typically add a Set node immediately following the trigger node, and put all the variables I need in this. It helps to make the workflows easier to update and maintain.\n- **A Nostr Write node** (from Nostrobots) – Writes a Kind-1 note to the Nostr network. It accepts Nostr credentials, the output of the Form node, and the relays from the Set node, and posts the Note to those relays.\n\nOnce the workflow is built, you can test it with the testing form URL, and set it to \"Active\" to use the production form URL. That's it. You can now give posting access to anyone for any Npub. To revoke access, simply change the credentials or set to workflow to \"Inactive\". \n\nIt may also be the world's simplest Nostr client.\n\nYou can find the [Nostr Form to Post a Note workflow here](https://github.com/r0d8lsh0p/nostr-n8n/blob/main/Nostr_Form_to_Post_a_Note.json).\n\n#### Push notifications on mentions and new notes\n\nOne of the things Nostr is not very good at is push notifications. Furthermore I have some unique itches to scratch. I want–\n\n- **To make sure I never miss a note addressed to any of my Npubs** – For this I want a push notification any time any Nostr user mentions any of my Npubs,\n- **To make sure I always see all notes from key accounts** – For this I need a push notification any time any of my Npubs post any Notes to the network,\n- **To get these notifications on all of my devices** – Not just my phone where my Nostr regular client lives, but also on each of my laptops to suit wherever I am working that day.\n\nI needed to build a Nostr push notifications solution.\n\nTo build this workflow I had to string a few ideas together–\n\n- **Triggering the node on a schedule** – Nostrobots does not include a trigger node. As every workflow starts with a trigger we needed a different method. I elected to run the workflow on a schedule of every 10-minutes. Frequent enough to see Notes while they are hot, but infrequent enough to not burden public relays or get rate-limited,\n- **Storing a list of Npubs in a Nostr list** – I needed a way to store the list of Npubs that trigger my notifications. I initially used an array defined in the workflow, this worked fine. Then I decided to try Nostr lists ([NIP-51, kind 30000](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md)). By defining my list of Npubs as a list published to Nostr I can control my list from within a Nostr client (e.g. [Listr.lol](https://listr.lol/npub1r0d8u8mnj6769500nypnm28a9hpk9qg8jr0ehe30tygr3wuhcnvs4rfsft) or [Nostrudel.ninja](https://nostrudel.ninja/#/lists)). Not only does this \"just work\", but because it's based on Nostr lists automagically Amethyst client allows me to browse that list as a Feed, and everyone I add gets notified in their Mentions,\n- **Using specific relays** – I needed to query the right relays, including my own HAVEN relay inbox for notes addressed to me, and wss://purplepag.es for Nostr profile metadata,\n- **Querying Nostr events** (with Nostrobots) – I needed to make use of many different Nostr queries and use quite a wide range of what Nostrobots can do–\n\t- I read the EventID of my Kind 30000 list, to return the desired pubkeys,\n\t- For notifications on mentions, I read all Kind 1 notes that mention that pubkey,\n\t- For notifications on new notes, I read all Kind 1 notes published by that pubkey,\n\t- Where there are notes, I read the Kind 0 profile metadata event of that pubkey to get the displayName of the relevant Npub,\n\t- I transform the EventID into a Nevent to help clients find it.\n- **Using the Nostr URI** – As I did with my NFC card article, I created a link with the `nostr:` URI prefix so that my phone's native client opens the link by default,\n- **Push notifications solution** – I needed a push notifications solution. I found many with n8n integrations and chose to go with [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) which supports all my devices, has a free trial, and is unfairly cheap with a $5-per-device perpetual license.\n\nOnce the workflow was built, lists published, and Pushover installed on my phone, I was fully set up with push notifications on Nostr. I have used these workflows for several weeks now and made various tweaks as I went. They are feeling robust and I'd welcome you to give them a go.\n\nYou can find the [Nostr Push Notification If Mentioned here](https://github.com/r0d8lsh0p/nostr-n8n/blob/main/Nostr_Push_Notify_If_Mentioned.json) and [If Posts a Note here](https://github.com/r0d8lsh0p/nostr-n8n/blob/main/Nostr_Push_Notify_If_Post_a_Note.json).\n\nIn speaking with other Nostr users while I was building this, there are all kind of other needs for push notifications too – like on replies to a certain bookmarked note, or when a followed Npub starts streaming on zap.stream. These are all possible.\n\n#### Use my workflows\n\nI have open sourced all my workflows at my [Github](https://github.com/r0d8lsh0p/nostr-n8n) with MIT license and tried to write complete docs, so that you can import them into your n8n and configure them for your own use. \n\nTo import any of my workflows–\n\n- Click on the workflow of your choice, e.g. \"[Nostr_Push_Notify_If_Mentioned.json](https://github.com/r0d8lsh0p/nostr-n8n/blob/main/Nostr_Push_Notify_If_Mentioned.json \"Nostr_Push_Notify_If_Mentioned.json\")\",\n- Click on the \"raw\" button to view the raw JSON, ex any Github page layout,\n- Copy that URL,\n- Enter that URL in the \"import from URL\" dialog [mentioned above](#creating-and-adding-workflows).\n\nTo configure them–\n\n- Prerequisites, credentials, and variables are all stated,\n- In general any variables required are entered into a Set Node that follows the trigger node,\n- Pushover has some extra setup but is very straightforward and documented in the workflow.\n\n### What next?\n\nOver my first four blogs I explored creating a good Nostr setup with [Vanity Npub](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/mining-your-vanity-pubkey-4iupbf/), [Lightning Payments](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/setting-up-payments-on-nostr-7o6ls7/), [Nostr Addresses at Your Domain](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/ee8a46bc/), and [Personal Nostr Relay](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/8ca68889/).\n\nThen in my latest two blogs I explored different types of interoperability [with NFC cards](https://rodbishop.npub.pro/post/edde8387/) and now n8n Workflow Automation.\n\nThinking ahead n8n can power any kind of interoperability between Nostr and any other legacy technology solution. On my mind as I write this:\n\n- Further enhancements to posting and delegating solutions and forms (enhanced UI or different note kinds),\n- Automated or scheduled posting (such as auto-liking everything [Lyn Alden](nostr:npub1a2cww4kn9wqte4ry70vyfwqyqvpswksna27rtxd8vty6c74era8sdcw83a) posts),\n- Further enhancements to push notifications, on new and different types of events (such as notifying me when I get a new follower, on replies to certain posts, or when a user starts streaming),\n- All kinds of bridges, such as bridging notes to and from Telegram, Slack, or Campfire. Or bridging RSS or other event feeds to Nostr,\n- All kinds of other automation (such as [BlackCoffee](nostr:npub1dqepr0g4t3ahvnjtnxazvws4rkqjpxl854n29wcew8wph0fmw90qlsmmgt) [controlling a coffee machine](https://primal.net/e/note16fzhh5yfc3u4kufx0mck63tsfperdrlpp96am2lmq066cnuqutds8retc3)),\n- All kinds of AI Assistants and Agents,\n\nIn fact I have already released an open source workflow for an [AI Assistant](https://primal.net/p/npub1ahjpx53ewavp23g5zj9jgyfrpr8djmgjzg5mpe4xd0z69dqvq0kq2lf353), and will share more about that in my next blog.\n\nPlease be sure to let me know if you think there's another Nostr topic you'd like to see me tackle.\n\nGM Nostr.","sig":"cd6bdf51b30688bc4b632ad4796d0dc475ed3dd6e258500edc9c0b01130b86076510e71bfcb02ef97e094e77da5808d5283e5d2cd99f968f61c4b381c87c16b2"},"naddr1qqyrsetpvc6ngvpsqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnwdaehgu3wvfskueqzyqg0u0mscq6v6yy8wr8920p6yk80gzuxzchwp6pg9rd748f538ypqqcyqqq823c5l98ng":{"kind":30023,"id":"80c0473469d70b827430fda451a8e27d8b35c2c791483f26a5abd33ed691a45f","pubkey":"10fe3f70c034cd108770ce553c3a258ef40b86162ee0e82828dbea9d3489c810","created_at":1745033326,"tags":[["d","8eaf5400"],["title","My honest take on Nostr"],["summary","How to use Nostr for beginners."],["published_at","1736841894"],["t","nostr"],["t","nostr_writer"],["t","review"],["t","beginner"],["t","obsidian"],["t","anytype"],["t","contract_drafting"],["t","agreenent_drafting"],["t","lawyer"],["t","law"],["t","contract"],["t","agreement"],["t","learn"],["t","education"],["t","plugin"],["t","telegram"],["t","wordpress"],["t","yakihonne"],["t","primal"],["t","damus"],["published_at","1736841894"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqy878acvqdxdzzrhpnj48saztrh5pwrpvthqaq5z3kl2n56gnjqsqqyrsetpvc6ngvpsan525m"],["p","10fe3f70c034cd108770ce553c3a258ef40b86162ee0e82828dbea9d3489c810"],["a","30023:df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67:why-im-on-nostr","wss://relay.damus.io/","mention"],["p","df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67"]],"content":"#nostr #nostr_writer #review #beginner #obsidian #anytype #contract_drafting #agreenent_drafting #lawyer #law #contract #agreement #learn #education #plugin #telegram #wordpress #yakihonne #primal #damus\n## How and Why I found Nostr?\n\nI teach contract drafting. That is [who I am](nostr:npub1zrlr7uxqxnx3ppmsee2ncw393m6qhpsk9msws2pgm04f6dyfeqgqysp2qj).\n\nTo teach the subject I maintained few websites through self-hosted [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org). I faced numerous challenges despite spending money on hosting, domain and whatnot. I do not have any technical background. So, you can understand my frustration when my websites kept disappearing due to hacking. I always put a brave face and started afresh. \n\nI used Microsoft Word, Power Point, and Obsidian to draft my posts and lessons. So, I had some backups. Thankfully, I also did post some of the training sessions on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Contract_drafting). Checkout my previous post for link to the [Youtube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUx4vOXTq5CyNPZjy0zk9z9BQdVJkqke_\u0026si=iEBKBsaCOFgN26of).\n\nSince, I teach for free, every time my websites were hacked, it pained me to see the bad side of human race. I was not hurting anyone, spending my own money, still someone unknown to me, for whatever reasons, could stop my mission. \n\nI started empathising with the belief in the internet being dysfunctional and still being beyond reach of common man. \n\nThen I found some hope, when around a year or so earlier, I found [Anytype](https://anytype.io). A simple app, the everything app, which promises anonymity, security from data breach, and a promise to share ones thoughts publicly with the others soon via web. Although some of its features (e.g. option to self host) are little bit technical for me, I still have high hopes. It is similar to Obsidian, yet way more than that.\n\nI could use either [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or [Anytype](https://anytype.io) for writing and publishing my data on web. So, I recently surrendered to the idea of using one of Obsidian's plugins to publish my content. These provide the option to publish your obsidian notes on web through sub-domain. One that I used before was [Obsius Plugin](https://github.com/jonstodle/obsius-obsidian-plugin).\n\nBut, secretly I also wished want more. \n\nI wished to maintain my same anonymous profile I have on [Telegram](https://t.me/CONTRACT_DRAFTING). I have a dedicated student base on Telegram. So, I wanted them to easily find me or atleast my content on a new platform. \n\nI also wanted to stop spending more money, or at least save some by spending less.\n  \nAnd, voila! \n\nI came across Nostr unexpectedly through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and found a Plugin [Nostr Writer](https://github.com/jamesmagoo/nostr-writer) by [James](https://github.com/jamesmagoo). \n\nI was looking for a simple method to host my blog posts and lessons on contract drafting. And, I found much more....\n\nIf you have some other compelling reasons, as Marc, do read his piece on why he is on Nostr - [Why I'm on Nostr?]([nostr:naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzph68s45y080zdd9g8sdacnd6kcd4ejpwrgcju2eghjq45y4f28n8qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyv9kh2uewd9hj7qghwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46z7qgwwaehxw309ahx7uewd3hkctcppemhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mp0qythwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2ap0qq8hw6re945k6tt0dckkummnw3eq7dj2z0))\n\n## What did I find?\n\nAfter going through the Nostr Writer](https://github.com/jamesmagoo/nostr-writer) documentation on Github, I searched for Nostr and found [NOSTR.COM](https://nostr.com). \n\nAs expected, it took me some time to understand the concepts of Public and Private Keys, Clients, Relays and so on. But, within 2-3 days, I found that this was just a SMALL TIP of a HUGE ICEBERG, yet to be show it's full potential. \n\nMy most sincere thank you to its creator, and to people who spend time explaining it and making it AWESOME.\n#### **NOSTR's CONCEPTS**\n\nIf you want to READ ABOUT NOSTR's CONCEPTS, you can go through the following:\n\n1. [Intro by Nostr's founder-FLATJAF](https://fiatjaf.com/nostr.html)\n2. [NOSTR Website](https://nostr.com)\n3. [NOSTR Guide](https://nostr.how/en/what-is-nostr)\n\nI also went through almost each and every youtube video I could find on Nostr onboarding and much more. Although, these are very few, I found each one of them to be very useful. I have listed some of these below. \n#### Nostr Onboarding videos\n\nMy most sincere thank you to each of the creators (), who took time to explain the onabording by various methods.\n\n1. By Ares - [how to get started with Nostr on mobile](https://youtu.be/uwRvBXd0hGY) - 3 minutes approx\n2. By Castig- [How to get started on Nostr](https://youtu.be/Czkv54pQfTI) \t- 7 minutes approx\n3. By Max Demarco- [Create your Nostr Account- Beginnner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/kifwECtwjJQ) - 18 minutes approx \n4. By Nostr World - [Nostr for Beginners w/ Derek Ross](https://youtu.be/NVm_jGdwTjQ) - 37 minutes approx\n5. By 88 Sats Radio- [how to get started on Nostr](https://youtu.be/DOShMOgsCvg) - 48 minutes approx\n\nI suggest every beginner must watch all of these videos, create as many accounts you need, and do it until you understand the whole Idea. \n\nThis is just the beginning of what to come. So, do not stop using Nostr. In fact refer to friends and family and ask them to join.\n\n#### **Bonus of Nostr**\n\nYou can get paid in Bitcoins! Without spending a dime!!\n\nYes, you read it correct. \n\nAll you need to do is have a lighting wallet. \n\nI leave it to you explore for now. I am still reviewing the payment structure. So, I will write about how to use this feature later. \n\nMeanwhile I suggest, you go through [BTC Session's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BTCSessions) to learn more about bitcoins, wallets, zaps/sats, lighting, etc. \n#### What else do you need? \n\nPretty much you have the basics if you did everything suggested above. \n\nIf you have a question, you can ask someone within any of the Nostr Clients. \n\n### NOSTR CLIENTS\n\nI am experimenting with following Nostr Clients (apps to read your notes, pictures,  and long form content) on my apple devices on web.\n\nDamus\nPrimal \nYakihonne\n### NOSTR APPSTORE\n\nYou can find many more clients at \n\n[GetAlby's App Store](https://getalby.com/discover)\n[Nostr App Store 1](https://nostrapp.link)\n[Nostr App Store 2](https://nostrapps.com)\n\nSo, Good luck to you and *Happy Nostring*\n\n**Only the Human Imagination is the limit of what you can do with Nostr**\n\nIf you liked this article, share it with your friends.","sig":"c70f0e662028c7a76aea07a269ccf4b936a326355d1587435694420e9a50b6858dc1ccf46c05064c2b8b3c0f187d656ed3f8a86ec4aee347e7b8251316aaf173"},"naddr1qqyrzwrxvc6ngvfkqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyqalp33lewf5vdq847t6te0wvnags0gs0mu72kz8938tn24wlfze6qcyqqq823cpsau4v":{"kind":30023,"id":"e775d764f8ae3088445e4d29b795b9b1de00d2ba34fe8148db82fe47b3534c48","pubkey":"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d","created_at":1745609208,"tags":[["d","18ff5416"],["title","Redistributing Git with Nostr"],["published_at","1745594880"],["t","nostr"]],"content":"\n# Redistributing Git with Nostr\n\nEvery time someone tries to \"decentralize\" Git -- like many projects tried in the past to do it with BitTorrent, IPFS, ScuttleButt or custom p2p protocols -- there is always a lurking comment: \"but Git is already distributed!\", and then the discussion proceeds to mention some facts about how Git supports multiple remotes and its magic syncing and merging abilities and so on.\n\nTurns out all that is true, Git is indeed all that powerful, and yet GitHub is the big central hub that hosts basically all Git repositories in the giant world of open-source. There are some crazy people that host their stuff elsewhere, but these projects end up not being found by many people, and even when they do they suffer from lack of contributions.\n\nBecause everybody has a GitHub account it's easy to open a pull request to a repository of a project you're using if it's on GitHub (to be fair I think it's very annoying to have to clone the repository, then add it as a remote locally, push to it, then go on the web UI and click to open a pull request, then that cloned repository lurks forever in your profile unless you go through 16 screens to delete it -- but people in general seem to think it's easy).\n\nIt's much harder to do it on some random other server where some project might be hosted, because now you have to add 4 more even more annoying steps: create an account; pick a password; confirm an email address; setup SSH keys for pushing. (And I'm not even mentioning the basic impossibility of offering `push` access to external _unknown_ contributors to people who want to host their own simple homemade Git server.)\n\nAt this point some may argue that we could all have accounts on GitLab, or Codeberg or wherever else, then those steps are removed. Besides not being a practical strategy this pseudo solution misses the point of being decentralized (or distributed, who knows) entirely: it's far from the ideal to force everybody to have the double of account management and SSH setup work in order to have the open-source world controlled by two shady companies instead of one.\n\nWhat we want is to give every person the opportunity to host their own Git server without being ostracized. at the same time we must recognize that most people won't want to host their own servers (not even most open-source programmers!) and give everybody the ability to host their stuff on multi-tenant servers (such as GitHub) too. Importantly, though, if we allow for a random person to have a standalone Git server on a standalone server they host themselves on their wood cabin that also means any new hosting company can show up and start offering Git hosting, with or without new cool features, charging high or low or zero, and be immediately competing against GitHub or GitLab, i.e. we must remove the network-effect centralization pressure.\n\n### External contributions\n\nThe first problem we have to solve is: how can Bob contribute to Alice's repository without having an account on Alice's server?\n\nSourceHut has reminded GitHub users that Git has always had this (for most) arcane `git send-email` command that is the original way to send patches, using an once-open protocol.\n\nTurns out Nostr acts as a quite powerful email replacement and can be used to send text content just like email, therefore patches are a very good fit for Nostr event contents.\n\nOnce you get used to it and the proper UIs (or CLIs) are built sending and applying patches to and from others becomes a much easier flow than the intense clickops mixed with terminal copypasting that is interacting with GitHub (you have to clone the repository on GitHub, then update the remote URL in your local directory, then create a branch and then go back and turn that branch into a Pull Request, it's quite tiresome) that many people already dislike so much they went out of their way to build many GitHub CLI tools just so they could comment on issues and approve pull requests from their terminal.\n\n## Replacing GitHub features\n\nAside from being the \"hub\" that people use to send patches to other people's code (because no one can do the email flow anymore, justifiably), GitHub also has 3 other big features that are not directly related to Git, but that make its network-effect harder to overcome. Luckily Nostr can be used to create a new environment in which these same features are implemented in a more decentralized and healthy way.\n\n### Issues: bug reports, feature requests and general discussions\n\nSince the \"Issues\" GitHub feature is just a bunch of text comments it should be very obvious that Nostr is a perfect fit for it.\n\nI will not even mention the fact that Nostr is much better at threading comments than GitHub (which doesn't do it at all), which can generate much more productive and organized discussions (and you can opt out if you want).\n\n### Search\n\nI use GitHub search all the time to find libraries and projects that may do something that I need, and it returns good results almost always. So if people migrated out to other code hosting providers wouldn't we lose it?\n\nThe fact is that even though we think everybody is on GitHub that is a globalist falsehood. Some projects are not on GitHub, and if we use only GitHub for search those will be missed. So even if we didn't have a Nostr Git alternative it would still be necessary to create a search engine that incorporated GitLab, Codeberg, SourceHut and whatnot.\n\nTurns out on Nostr we can make that quite easy by not forcing anyone to integrate custom APIs or hardcoding Git provider URLs: each repository can make itself available by publishing an \"announcement\" event with a brief description and one or more Git URLs. That makes it easy for a search engine to index them -- and even automatically download the code and index the code (or index just README files or whatever) without a centralized platform ever having to be involved.\n\nThe relays where such announcements will be available play a role, of course, but that isn't a bad role: each announcement can be in multiple relays known for storing \"public good\" projects, some relays may curate only projects known to be very good according to some standards, other relays may allow any kind of garbage, which wouldn't make them good for a search engine to rely upon, but would still be useful in case one knows the exact thing (and from whom) they're searching for (the same is valid for all Nostr content, by the way, and that's where it's censorship-resistance comes from).\n\n### Continuous integration\n\nGitHub Actions are a very hardly subsidized free-compute-for-all-paid-by-Microsoft feature, but one that isn't hard to replace at all. In fact there exists today many companies offering the same kind of service out there -- although they are mostly targeting businesses and not open-source projects, before GitHub Actions was introduced there were also many that were heavily used by open-source projects.\n\nOne problem is that these services are still heavily tied to GitHub today, they require a GitHub login, sometimes BitBucket and GitLab and whatnot, and do not allow one to paste an arbitrary Git server URL, but that isn't a thing that is very hard to change anyway, or to start from scratch. All we need are services that offer the CI/CD flows, perhaps using the same framework of GitHub Actions (although I would prefer to not use that messy garbage), and charge some few satoshis for it.\n\nIt may be the case that all the current services only support the big Git hosting platforms because they rely on their proprietary APIs, most notably the webhooks dispatched when a repository is updated, to trigger the jobs. It doesn't have to be said that Nostr can also solve that problem very easily.\n","sig":"87caf0e3a5cc69e3f3ef3e60ba7167a0f3e88bbed36bee8365b08a291e6429f050b58d26263d7c0d7b2dbaf6a92881e4126f29051cf8a76f46bc83dd82f60dd6"},"naddr1qqyx2eryv5urxwphqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3qr0d8u8mnj6769500nypnm28a9hpk9qg8jr0ehe30tygr3wuhcnvsxpqqqp65wgga7mw":{"kind":30023,"id":"219ec1993a7313f049a8bc023e1130da5aa6c33ed62aed46b82549c75553b47b","pubkey":"1bda7e1f7396bda2d1ef99033da8fd2dc362810790df9be62f591038bb97c4d9","created_at":1732162628,"tags":[["d","edde8387"],["title","Using NFC Cards with Nostr"],["summary","How to use NFC Cards for logging into Nostr, and for giving out to grow your Nostr personal network."],["published_at","1732150124"],["published_at","1732150124"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzqx760c0h894a5tg7lxgr8k506twrv2qs0yxln0nz7kgs8zae03xeqqyx2eryv5urxwphauv5l6"],["p","d7c6d014b342815ba29c48f3449e4f0073df84f4ad580ae173538041a6abb6b8"],["e","b33e44a498245fce1eb335cb8ef5e876fb7d0f02968565bd93e85502cc6bd7b2","wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net/","mention"],["p","aef0d6b212827f3ba1de6189613e6d4824f181f567b1205273c16895fdaf0b23"],["p","85080d3bad70ccdcd7f74c29a44f55bb85cbcd3dd0cbb957da1d215bdb931204"],["e","d33fb8df4f4e16d3cca6c4cd3b8142962bc82fb699cc054ccd0fc3a562c66f46","wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net/","mention"],["p","1bda7e1f7396bda2d1ef99033da8fd2dc362810790df9be62f591038bb97c4d9"],["a","30023:1bda7e1f7396bda2d1ef99033da8fd2dc362810790df9be62f591038bb97c4d9:ee8a46bc","wss://nostr.wine/","mention"],["a","30023:1bda7e1f7396bda2d1ef99033da8fd2dc362810790df9be62f591038bb97c4d9:Mining-your-Vanity-Pubkey-4iupbf","","mention"],["a","30023:1bda7e1f7396bda2d1ef99033da8fd2dc362810790df9be62f591038bb97c4d9:Setting-up-Payments-on-Nostr-7o6ls7","","mention"],["t","CheatCode"],["t","nostr"],["t","grownostr"],["t","nfc"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/519507bc0690703b37a48147a816ea783dc7e520a77b9b3d3be55ceb4e19866e.jpg"],["published_at","1732150124"]],"content":"### Tldr\n\n- Nostr is an open protocol which is interoperable with all kinds of other technologies\n- You can use this interoperability to create custom solutions\n- Nostr apps define a custom URI scheme handler \"nostr:\"\n- In this blog I use this to integrate Nostr with NFC cards\n- I create a Nostr NFC \"login card\" which allows me to log into Amethyst client\n- I create a Nostr NFC \"business card\" which allows anyone to find my profile with a tap\n\n### Inter-Op All The Things!\n\nNostr is a new open social protocol for the internet. This open nature is very exciting because it means Nostr can add new capabilities to all other internet-connected technologies, from browsers to web applications. In my view, it achieves this through three core capabilities. \n\n- A lightweight decentralised identity (Nostr keys, \"npubs\" and \"nsecs\"),  \n- A lightweight data distribution network (Nostr relays),\n- A set of data interoperability standards (The Nostr Improvement Protocols \"NIPs\"), including the \"nostr:\" URI which we'll use in this post.\n\nThe lightweight nature is its core strength. Very little is required to interoperate with Nostr, which means many existing technologies can be easily used with the network.\n\nOver the next few blog posts, I'll explore different Nostr inter-op ideas, and also deliver my first small open source projects to the community. I'll cover–\n\n- NFC cards integrated with Nostr (in this post),\n- Workflow Automations integrated with Nostr,\n- AI LLMs integrated with Nostr.\n\n#### The \"Nostr:\" URI\n\nOne feature of Nostr is it defines a custom URI scheme handler \"nostr:\". What is that?\n\nA URI is used to identify a resource in a system. A system will have a protocol handler registry used to store such URI's, and if a system has a URI registered, then it knows what to do when it sees it. You are probably already familiar with some URI schemes such as \"http:\" and \"mailto:\". For example, when you click an http link, the system knows that it describes an http resource and opens a web browser to fetch the content from the internet.\n\nA nostr: link operates in the same way. The nostr: prefix indicates a custom URI scheme specifically designed for the Nostr protocol. If a system has a Nostr application installed, that application may have registered \"nostr:\" in the protocol handler registry. On that system when a \"nostr:\" URI is clicked, the system will know that it describes a nostr resource and open the Nostr client to fetch the content from the nostr relay network.\n\nThis inter-op with the protocol handler registry gives us the power to do nice and exciting things with other technologies.\n### Nostr and NFC\n\nAnother technology that uses URIs is NFC cards. NFC (Near Field Communication) is a wireless technology that enables devices to exchange data over a few centimeters. It’s widely used in contactless payments, access control, and information sharing. \n\nNFC tags are small chips embedded in cards or stickers which can store data like plain text, URLs, or custom URIs. They are very cheap (cents each) and widely available (Amazon with next day delivery).\n\nWhen an NFC tag contains a URI, such as a http: (or nostr:) link, it acts as a trigger. Tapping the tag with an NFC-enabled device launches the associated application and processes the URI. For example, tapping a tag with \"nostr:...\" could open a Nostr client, directing it to a specific login page, public profile, or event. \n\nThis inter-op allows us to bridge the physical world to Nostr with just a tap.\n\n#### Many useful ideas\n\nThere are many interesting ways to use this. Too many for me to explore. Perhaps some of these are interesting for your next side hustle?\n\n- Nostr NFC \"login cards\" – tap to log into Amethyst on Android,\n- Nostr NFC \"business cards\" – give to connections so they can tap to load your npub,\n- Nostr NFC \"payment cards\" – integrating lightning network or ecash,\n- Nostr NFC \"doorbells\", \"punch cards\", \"drop boxes\", or \"dead drops\" – put a tag in a specific place and tap to open a location-specific message or chat,\n- Integrations with other access control systems,\n- Integrations with other home automation systems, \n- Many more ...\n\nTo start with I have built and use the \"login card\" and \"business card\" solutions. This blog post will show you how to do the same.\n\n### Nostr Login Card\n\nYou can use an NFC card to log into your Nostr client.\n\nMost Nostr clients accept a variety of login methods, from posting your nsec into the app (insecure) to using a remote signer (more secure). A less known but more secure method is to sign into a session with a tap of a specially-configured NFC card. Amethyst is a Nostr client on Android which supports this type of login.\n\n- A secure method for logging in\n- Optionally keeps no log in history on the device after logout\n- Does not require users to know or understand how keys work\n- Keys are kept secure on a physically-separated card to reduce risk of compromise\n\nNostr devs think that this is useful for anti-establishment actors–Fair enough. For me, I am interested in this login card pattern as it could be useful for rolling out identities within an organisation context with less training (office workers are already familiar with door access cards). This pattern potentially abstracts away key management to the IT or ops team who provision the cards.\n\nI first discovered this when [Kohei](nostr:npub16lrdq99ng2q4hg5ufre5f8j0qpealp8544vq4ctn2wqyrf4tk6uqn8mfeq) demonstrated it in [his video](nostr:nevent1qqstx0jy5jvzgh7wr6entjuw7h58d7mapupfdpt9hkf7s4gze34a0vspremhxue69uhkummnw3ez6ur4vgh8wetvd3hhyer9wghxuet59upzp47x6q2txs5ptw3fcj8ngj0y7qrnm7z0ft2cptshx5uqgxn2hd4ckqyqd3).\n\nHere's how you set it up at a high level–\n\n1. Buy yourself some NFC cards\n2. Get your Nostr key ready in an encrypted, password protected format called \"nencryptsec\"\n3. Write the nencryptsec to the NFC card as a custom URI\n4. Tap to load the login screen, and enter your password to login\n\nHere it is in detail–\n\n#### Buy yourself some NFC cards\n\nI found no specific requirements. As usual with Nostr so far, I tried to the cheapest possible route and it worked. Generic brand NFC cards shipped from China, I believe it was 50X for $15 from Amazon. Your mileage may vary.\n\n#### Get your Nostr key ready\n\nYour key will be saved to the NFC card in an encrypted password-protected format called \"nencryptsec\". Several applications support this. As we'll be using this to login to Amethyst, we will use Amethyst to output the nencryptsec for us.\n\n1. Login to Amethyst with your nsec,\n2. Open the sidebar and click \"Backup Keys\",\n3. Enter a password, and click \"Encrypt and my secret key\",\n4. It will add the password-protected key to your clipboard in the format \"ncryptsec1...\",\n5. Remember to backup your password.\n\n#### Write the ncryptsec to the NFC card\n \n1. Download the free [NFC Tools app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc) to your device, and open it,\n2. Click \"Write\" and \"Add a record\", then click \"Custom URL / URI\",\n3. Paste your nencryptsec with the nostr URI in front, i.e. \"nostr:ncryptsec1...\" and click OK,\n4. Click \"Write\". NFC Tools will prompt you to \"Approach an NFC tag\",\n5. Place your NFC card against your phone, and it will write to the card,\n6. Your card is ready.\n\n#### Tap to load the login screen\n\nTap the card against your phone again, and your phone should open the login screen of Amethyst and prompt you for your password. \n\nOnce you enter your password, Amethyst will decrypt your nsec and log you in. \n\nOptionally, you can also set the app to forget you once you log out.\n\nYou have created a Nostr NFC \"login card\".\n\n### Nostr Business Card\n\nYou can use another NFC card to give anyone you meet a link straight to your Nostr profile.\n\nI attended [Peter McCormack](nostr:npub14mcddvsjsflnhgw7vxykz0ndfqj0rq04v7cjq5nnc95ftld0pv3shcfrlx)'s #CheatCode conference in Sydney and gave a few of these out following the Nostr panel, notably to [Preston Pysh](nostr:npub1s5yq6wadwrxde4lhfs56gn64hwzuhnfa6r9mj476r5s4hkunzgzqrs6q7z) where it [got some cut through](nostr:nevent1qqsdx0acma85u9knejnvfnfms9pfv27g97mfnnq9fnxslsa9vtrx73spremhxue69uhkummnw3ez6ur4vgh8wetvd3hhyer9wghxuet59upzppggp5a66uxvmntlwnpf5384twu9e0xnm5xth9ta58fpt0dexysy26d4nm) and found me my first 100 followers. You can do the same.\n\nTo create your Nostr NFC \"business card\" is even easier than your NFC \"login card\".\n\n1. Buy yourself some NFC cards,\n2. Download the free [NFC Tools app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc) to your device, and open it,\n2. Click \"Write\" and \"Add a record\", then click \"Custom URL / URI\",\n3. Write your npub to the NFC card as a custom URI in the format \"nostr:npub1...\" (e.g. for me this is \"nostr:npub1r0d8u8mnj6769500nypnm28a9hpk9qg8jr0ehe30tygr3wuhcnvs4rfsft\"),\n4. Your card is ready.\n\nGive the card to someone who is a Nostr user, and when they tap the card against their phone it will open their preferred Nostr client and go directly to your Nostr profile page.\n\nYou have created a Nostr NFC \"business card\".\n\n### What I Did Wrong\n\nI like to share what I did wrong so you don't have to make the same mistakes. This time, this was very easy, and little went wrong. In general\n\n- When password-protecting your nsec, don't forget the password!\n- When writing to the NFC card, make sure to use \"Custom URI/URL\" as this accepts your \"nostr:\" URI scheme. If you use generic \"URI/URL\" it won't work.\n\n### What's Next\n\nOver my first four blogs I have explored creating a good Nostr setup\n\n- [Mined a Nostr pubkey and backed up the mnemonic](nostr:naddr1qqsy66twd9hxwtteda6hyt2kv9hxjare94g82cntv4uj6drfw4cxyeszyqda5lslwwttmgk3a7vsx0dgl5kuxc5pq7gdlxlx9av3qw9mjlzdjqcyqqq823c6e2ekw)\n- [Set up Nostr payments with a Lightning wallet plus all the bells and whistles](nostr:naddr1qq34xet5w35kueedw4cz65rp09kk2mn5wvkk7m3dfehhxarj95mk7dnvwvmsygqmmflp7uukhk3drmueqv763lfdcd3gzpusm7d7vt6ezquth97ymypsgqqqw4rsuql6je)\n- [Set up NIP-05 and Lighting Address at my own domain](nostr:naddr1qqyx2efcvy6rvcnrqyghwumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2tczyqda5lslwwttmgk3a7vsx0dgl5kuxc5pq7gdlxlx9av3qw9mjlzdjqcyqqq823c634nh0) \n- [Set up a Personal Relay at my own domain](nostr:naddr1qqyx2efcvy6rvcnrqy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyv9kh2uewd9hj7q3qr0d8u8mnj6769500nypnm28a9hpk9qg8jr0ehe30tygr3wuhcnvsxpqqqp65wmzpn9e)\n\nOver the next few blogs I will be exploring different types of Nostr inter-op\n\n- NFC cards integrated with Nostr (this post)\n- Workflow Automations integrated with Nostr\n- AI LLMs integrated with Nostr\n\nPlease be sure to let me know if you think there's another Nostr topic you'd like to see me tackle.\n\nGM Nostr.","sig":"c25a34f86dfe9aabfef9509ad2f3966f799807c0c38c93e5e5162faeea8fd3a374d6c7db380a3198be30fd978ca9a57dff1111b5bfb901774058145b5c77f9d1"},"naddr1qqyxg6tnvdhhvetjqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnswf5k6ctv9ehx2aqzyq7r38y0f4rv4qf3vap68ceuakcaqcvlsauwuax5wfjhwhn69mlh7qcyqqq823cxx2ljj":{"kind":30023,"id":"0f9c42540edacc1a2f68a6d2b7bf1ffa0059edd61934a472e504efda06cc59a0","pubkey":"3c389c8f4d46ca81316743a3e33cedb1d0619f8778ee74d47265775e7a2eff7f","created_at":1745951926,"tags":[["d","discover"],["title","Discover."],["summary","Let go of the algorithms and truly discover what it means to explore."],["published_at","1745951926"],["t","nostr"]],"content":"Let go of the algorithms and truly discover what it means to explore.\nSocial media used to mean something. Once upon a time, it was a way to stay connected to friends, family, and colleagues over things we enjoy. We could share, laugh, and learn. Over time, it has devolved into cheap entertainment at the cost of our privacy. Our relationships and interests have been shoved into a corner in order to make room for \"suggested posts\" and \"for you\" content designed to evaluate our attention for advertising purposes. We've lost what it means to truly connect, and we've lost what it means to explore our curiosities.\n\nEnter Nostr. A protocol designed to resist authoritative censorship, just happens to fix a whole lot of other problems, too. By removing the central authority, Nostr offers its users complete control of what we feed our minds. How do we break our algorithm dependency to find better content and better relationships again? We explore and discover:\n\n### The Chronological Life.\nThe existence of time may be debatable but our dependence on our perception of it is not. We live our lives chronologically. Why do our online lives need to be any different? There is no real reason, other than we've just gotten used to being engulfed by whatever the black box wants us to see. When we remove the algorithms, we find that online information flows just as it would in our daily lives. Important events get talked about by many people, over a long period of time. Things of less relevance fade. We see the rhythm of life reflected in our feed. This is an organic human experience transferred to the digital world. We depend on the people we know and the sources we trust to keep us informed about what really matters. We have fun, we move on. Nearly every Nostr social client brings this experience front and center through the traditional follow feed. Many use replies as a way to show you what is worth talking about for more than a hot minute. Its what old social media gave us, then took away. Nostr gives it back. It's not the only way to enjoy Nostr, though, so let's continue.\n### \"The Human Animal Differs From the Lesser Primates in His Passion for Lists\"\nWho doesn't love lists? (besides maybe to-do lists.) \nList functionality on Nostr is a powerful way to curate your feeds. You can make lists of artists, vendors, friends, or whatever you want. They can be public or private. You can subscribe to other people's public lists too. Make one to share with your friends. Many clients have list support and management. [Amethyst, Nostur, Voyage, and Nostrudel](nevent1qqs245js0tm8hpwejpw6nrk0kp46tgkhydusjhdvqll0nkxgw94ftgcpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mqzyq7r38y0f4rv4qf3vap68ceuakcaqcvlsauwuax5wfjhwhn69mlh7pjsj6k) are a few that come to mind. [Nostr.band](https://nostr.band) and [Listr.lol](https://listr.lol) offer in depth list management. Some clients even support lists for specific notes so that you can curate a feed by topic or aesthetic to share with your friends.\n\n### Being John Malcovich.\nEveryone has a different view of Nostr. Do you want to see what someone else is seeing? Sign in with any npub to get a different perspective. You might find profiles and content that you didn't know existed before. Some clients integrate variations of this feature right into their apps, so you don't have to log out of your account in order to step through that tiny door.\n\n### DV-what? DVM.\nData Vending Machines. These fancy little things are AIs tasked with a simple job: to find content for you. Most of these feeds are free, though some more personalized ones require a small fee. Many DVM services are stand-alone apps, like [Vendata](https://vendata.io) and [Noogle](https://noogle.lol) . These clever Nostr clients will let you do a lot more than just create feeds to browse notes. Explore if you wish. A few social clients have DVMs integrated, too, so if you see \"discovery\" or similar term on a tab, be sure to check it out.\n\n### Relays, Man. Relays.\nIt's right there in the name. Nostr- notes and other stuff transmitted by RELAY. Specialized relays exist for subjects, news, communities, personal spaces, content creators, cats... there's even a relay where everyone just says \"Good Morning\" to each other. Find a client that lets you browse a relay's contents, and enjoy the purest form of content discovery on Nostr. Unearthing these relays is getting better and better every day. Right now there are relay browsing capabilities in quite a few clients, like [Coracle, Relay Tools, Jumble and Nostur](nevent1qqs245js0tm8hpwejpw6nrk0kp46tgkhydusjhdvqll0nkxgw94ftgcpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mqzyq7r38y0f4rv4qf3vap68ceuakcaqcvlsauwuax5wfjhwhn69mlh7pjsj6k).\n\n### The Algo Relay.\nMaybe you've been busy and missed a lot. Maybe you are a sane person who rarely uses social media. Hook up with a [personalized algorithm relay](https://algo.utxo.one/) to catch you up on all the things you've missed. This is skirting the sharp edges of Nostr relay development, so keep in mind that not many implementations yet exist. Algo relay currently aims to bring the feel-good vibe of your chronological feed to an algorithmic feed, freeing up your time but letting you stay up with what 's going on in your social circles.\n\n### Trendy Trends.\nA few clients, relays, and DVM's have developed various Trending feeds. Catch up on what's popular across a wider view of the Nostr ecosystem. If trends are your thing, be sure to check them out.\n\nNow that you're equipped with the tools to explore Nostr, its time to go discover some great content and find your people. Feed your curiosity.","sig":"d634350a85c86292307bbd2d428da4e76f7fd0c4d66c6fe96cb13644df1f9f5146be24ed4f8361646c305f39b5b671a89ef50c26369932ecd2c2a94b853bce6d"},"naddr1qqyxueth94ehqetrqyt8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnwdaehgu3wvfskueqzyp4n0q8099eww0fhpwz28eg70256ud9lgy5n3h8mm8zlvwezzstvsqcyqqq823cmmu02p":{"kind":30023,"id":"3266de84b10bbd538083a00f818fca3fb5751944e31f6ecd739b4d5d1ad1d2e3","pubkey":"6b3780ef2972e73d370b84a3e51e7aa9ae34bf412938dcfbd9c5f63b221416c8","created_at":1746098766,"tags":[["d","new-spec"],["title","New spec is here"],["summary","We are excited to announce the finalization of our DVMCP specification update, which integrates the latest Model Context Protocol (MCP) version `2025-03-26` and other improvements.

This article highlights the key points of this update, and the differences between our initial vision and the final specification, providing insights into how our ideas evolved during the drafting process.\n\n## The Journey from Concept to Specification\n\nLast week, we shared our vision for updating the DVMCP specification to better integrate with the Model Context Protocol. After extensive drafting and feedback, we've finalized a specification that maintains our core vision while making important refinements to ensure optimal functionality, interoperability, and user experience. We are also improving the tagging of our specifications to make it more consistent, using the `draft` `mcp:2025-03-26` `rev1` tag to identify the version of the specification and the revision number we are in. We hope this will make the specification clearer and easier to track changes.\n\n## Key Changes in the Final Specification\n\n### Refined Event Kind Structure\n\nIn our initial proposal, we outlined a modular event structure with dedicated event kinds for server announcements (31316) and separate kinds for capability categories (31317, 31318, and 31319). The final specification maintains this approach but provides more detailed implementation guidelines.\n\n### Enhanced Ephemeral Events\n\nOne of the most significant refinements involves our approach to ephemeral events. The final specification clearly defines three ephemeral event kinds:\n\n- **Requests (25910)**: Client requests to servers\n- **Responses (26910)**: Server responses to client requests\n- **Notifications (21316)**: Status updates, progress information, and interactive elements\n\nThis approach provides a more efficient communication pattern while reducing unnecessary storage burden on relays.\n\n### Standardized Content Structure\n\nWhile our initial vision mentioned separating Nostr metadata and MCP payloads, the final specification provides concrete implementation details:\n\n- **Content Field**: Contains stringified MCP JSON-RPC messages, maintaining full compatibility with the MCP specification\n- **Tags Field**: Contains all Nostr-specific metadata using standardized tag patterns\n\nThis clear separation ensures that both protocols can operate seamlessly together without compromising either protocol's integrity.\n\n### Comprehensive Protocol Flows\n\nThe final specification includes detailed protocol flows for:\n\n1. **Public Server Discovery**: Finding servers through published announcements\n2. **Private Server Discovery**: Direct connection to servers using the MCP initialization process\n3. **Capability Operations**: Standardized patterns for listing, executing, and managing all capability types\n\nThese flows provide implementers with clear guidance on how to build compliant clients and servers.\n\n### Payment and Authorization\n\nThe specification now includes concrete implementations for payment handling and authorization:\n\n- **Payment Required Notifications**: Using the ephemeral notification kind (21316) with specific tag patterns\n- **Authorization Flow**: Leveraging Nostr's cryptographic properties for secure authorization\n\n## What Remained Consistent\n\nDespite these refinements, our core vision remained intact:\n\n1. **Expanded Capability Support**: The specification fully embraces MCP's complete capabilities framework, including tools, resources, and prompts\n2. **Modular Architecture**: The separation of server announcements and capability listings improves maintainability and extensibility\n3. **Protocol Interoperability**: The specification maintains compatibility with both Nostr and MCP\n\n## Implementation Status\n\nWith the specification now finalized, we're updating our reference implementations:\n\n- **DVMCP-bridge**: Server-side implementation for exposing MCP capabilities through Nostr\n- **DVMCP-discovery**: Client-side library for discovering and consuming MCP capabilities via Nostr\n\n## Community Involvement\n\nWe want to express our gratitude to everyone who provided feedback on our draft specification. Your insights helped shape a more robust and practical protocol.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nThis specification represents a significant advancement in bridging the Nostr and MCP ecosystems. By providing a standardized way to discover, access, and utilize MCP capabilities through the Nostr network, we're enabling new possibilities for applications.\n\nWe invite developers to explore the final specification and begin building with our reference implementations. Together, we can create a more open, interoperable, and powerful ecosystem\n\nThe complete specification is available at [2025-03-26.md](https://github.com/gzuuus/dvmcp/blob/master/docs/dvmcp-spec-2025-03-26.md).\n","sig":"096876603affd1f0943acd77498a3d3579b61b2424069aa386cec5d0b8fa3d5d6e90d3f70389f0e808b17f07ec5ea03d6907b200ba6c0d90675e7ba9197bf6c7"},"naddr1qqyxxepcvdjnyc3hqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3q80cvv07tjdrrgpa0j7j7tmnyl2yr6yr7l8j4s3evf6u64th6gkwsxpqqqp65w2ughlc":{"kind":30023,"id":"b17ebed34cc922927ce1bd34de1a60796450dd4e8202d4400907b8a957fd8e8f","pubkey":"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d","created_at":1729952303,"tags":[["d","cd8ce2b7"],["title","`kind:1` maximalism and the future of other stuff and Nostr decentralization"],["published_at","1729931520"],["t","nostr"]],"content":"\n# `kind:1` maximalism and the future of other stuff and Nostr decentralization\n\nThese two problems exist on Nostr today, and they look unrelated at first:\n\n  1. People adding more stuff to `kind:1` notes, such as making them editable, or adding special corky syntax thas has to be parsed and rendered in complicated UIs;\n  2. The _discovery_ of \"other stuff\" content (i.e. long-form articles, podcasts, calendar events, livestreams etc) is hard due to the fact that most people only use microblogging clients and they often don't appear there for them.\n\nPoint **2** above has 3 different solutions:\n\n  - **a.** Just publish everything as `kind:1` notes;\n  - **b.** Publish different things as different kinds, but make microblogging clients fetch all the event kinds from people you follow, then render them natively or use NIP-31, or NIP-89 to point users to other clients that would render them better;\n  - **c.** Publish different things as different kinds, and reference them in `kind:1` notes that would act as announcements to these other events, also relying on NIP-31 and NIP-89 for displaying references and recommending other clients.\n\nSolution **a** is obviously very bad, so I won't address it.\n\nFor a while I have believed solution **b** was the correct one, and many others seem to tacitly agree with it, given that some clients have been fetching more and more event kinds and going out of their way to render them in the same feed where only `kind:1` notes were originally expected to be.\n\nI don't think clients doing that is necessarily bad, but I do think this have some centralizing effects on the protocol, as it pushes clients to become bigger and bigger, raising the barrier to entry into the `kind:1` realm. And also in the past I have talked about the fact that I disliked that some clients would display my long-form articles as if they were normal `kind:1` notes and just dump them into the feeds of whoever was following me: nostr:nevent1qqsdk90k9k30vtzwpj6grxys9mvsegu5kkwd4jmpyhlmtjnxet2rvggprpmhxue69uhhyetvv9ujumn0wdmksetjv5hxxmmdqy8hwumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnddaksygpm7rrrljungc6q0tuh5hj7ue863q73qlheu4vywtzwhx42a7j9n5hae35c\n\nThese and other reasons have made me switch my preference to solution **c**, as it gives the most flexibility to the publisher: whoever wants to announce stuff so it can be _discovered_ can, whoever doesn't don't have to. And it allows microblogging clients the freedom to render just render tweets and having a straightforward barrier between what they can render and what is just a link to an external app or webapp (of course they can always opt to render the referenced content in-app if they want).\n\nIt also makes the case for microapps more evident. If all microblogging clients become superapps that can render recipe events perfectly why would anyone want to use a dedicated recipes app? I guess there are still reasons, but blurring the line between content kinds in superapps would definitely remove some of the reasons and eventually kill all the microapps.\n\n---\n\nThat brings us back to point **1** above (the overcomplication of `kind:1` events): if solution **c** is what we're going to, that makes `kind:1` events very special in Nostr, and not just another kind among others. Microblogging clients become the central plaza of Nostr, thus protecting their neutrality and decentralization much more important. Having a lot of clients with different userbases, doing things in slightly different ways, is essential for that decentralization.\n\nIt's ok if Nostr ends up having just 2 recipe-sharing clients, but it must have dozens of microblogging clients -- and maybe not even full-blown microblogging clients, but other apps that somehow deal with `kind:1` events in multiple ways. It's ok if implementing a client for public audio-rooms is very hard and complicated, but at the same time it should be very simple to write a client that can render a `kind:1` note referencing an audio-room and linking to that dedicated client.\n\nI hope you got my point and agreed because this article is ended.\n","sig":"86ff8b89c95c7353d4f50fffe0b48936c31aa53b99aaf9cc3af34be70babe293a91d3ad71146b0d04f73f7a48129c58951b5f9f9759c1e8dc1dfb114f356234f"},"naddr1qqyxzepcx3jnxc3nqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2q3q80cvv07tjdrrgpa0j7j7tmnyl2yr6yr7l8j4s3evf6u64th6gkwsxpqqqp65wf5lnua":{"kind":30023,"id":"caa65d8b3b11d887da7188f3fe75c33d7be80d3df8c46f241a275b9075888674","pubkey":"3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d","created_at":1730991377,"tags":[["d","ad84e3b3"],["title","The case against edits"],["published_at","1730973840"],["t","nostr"]],"content":"\n# The case against edits\n\nDirect edits are a centralizing force on Nostr, a slippery slope that should not be accepted.\n\nEdits are fine in other, more specialized event kinds, but the `kind:1` space shouldn't be compromised with such a push towards centralization, because [`kind:1` is the public square of Nostr, where all focus should be on decentralization and censorship-resistance](cd8ce2b7).\n\n- _Why?_\n\nEdits introduce too much complexity. If edits are widespread, all clients now have to download dozens of extra events at the same time while users are browsing a big feed of notes which are already coming from dozens of different relays using complicated outbox-model-based querying, then for each event they have to open yet another subscription to these relays -- or perform some other complicated batching of subscriptions which then requires more complexity on the event handling side and then when associating these edits with the original events. I can only imagine this will hurt apps performance, but it definitely raises the barrier to entry and thus necessarily decreases Nostr decentralization.\n\nSome clients may be implemneted in way such that they download tons of events and then store them in a local databases, from which they then construct the feed that users see. Such clients may make edits potentially easier to deal with -- but this is hardly an answer to the point above, since such clients are already more complex to implement in the first place.\n\n- _What do you have against complex clients?_\n\nThe point is not to say that all clients should be simple, but that it should be simple to write a client -- or at least as simple as physically possible.\n\nYou may not be thinking about it, but if you believe in the promise of Nostr then we should expect to see Nostr feeds in many other contexts other than on a big super app in a phone -- we should see Nostr notes being referenced from and injected in unrelated webpages, unrelated apps, hardware devices, comment sections and so on. All these micro-clients will have to implement some complicated edit-fetching logic now?\n\n- _But aren't we already fetching likes and zaps and other things, why not fetch edits too?_\n\nLikes, zaps and other similar things are optional. It's perfectly fine to use Nostr without seeing likes and/or zaps -- and, believe me, it does happen quite a lot. The point is basically that likes or zaps don't affect the content of the main post at all, while edits do.\n\n- _But edits are optional!_\n\nNo, they are not optional. If edits become widespread they necessarily become mandatory. Any client that doesn't implement edits will be displaying false information to its users and their experience will be completely broken.\n\n- _That's fine, as people will just move to clients that support edits!_\n\nExactly, that is what I expect to happen too, and this is why I am saying edits are a centralizing force that we should be fighting against, not embracing.\n\nIf you understand that edits are a centralizing force, then you must automatically agree that they aren't a desirable feature, given that if you are reading this now, with Nostr being so small, there is a 100% chance you care about decentralization and you're not just some kind of lazy influencer that is only doing this for money.\n\n- _All other social networks support editing!_\n\nThis is not true at all. Bluesky has 10x more users than Nostr and doesn't support edits. Instagram doesn't support editing pictures after they're posted, and doesn't support editing comments. Tiktok doesn't support editing videos or comments after they're posted. YouTube doesn't support editing videos after they're posted. Most famously, email, the most widely used and widespread \"social app\" out there, does not support edits of any kind. Twitter didn't support edits for the first 15 years of its life, and, although some people complained, it didn't hurt the platform at all -- arguably it benefitted it.\n\nIf edits are such a straightforward feature to add that won't hurt performance, that won't introduce complexity, and also that is such an essential feature users could never live without them, then why don't these centralized platforms have edits on everything already? There must be something there.\n\n- _Eventually someone will implement edits anyway, so why bother to oppose edits now?_\n\nOnce Nostr becomes big enough, maybe it will be already shielded from such centralizing forces by its sheer volume of users and quantity of clients, maybe not, we will see. All I'm saying is that we shouldn't just push for bad things now just because of a potential future in which they might come.\n\n- _The market will decide what is better._\n\nThe market has decided for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. If we were to follow what the market had decided we wouldn't be here, and you wouldn't be reading this post.\n\n- _OK, you have convinced me, edits are not good for the protocol. But what do we do about the users who just want to fix their typos?_\n\nThere are many ways. The annotations spec, for example, provides a simple way to append things to a note without being a full-blown edit, and they fall back gracefully to normal replies in  clients that don't implement the full annotations spec.\n\nEventually we could have annotations that are expressed in form of simple (human-readable?) diffs that can be applied directly to the post, but fall back, again, to comments.\n\nBesides these, a very simple idea that wasn't tried yet on Nostr yet is the idea that has been tried for emails and seems to work very well: delaying a post after the \"submit\" button is clicked and giving the user the opportunity to cancel and edit it again before it is actually posted.\n\nUltimately, if edits are so necessary, then maybe we could come up with a way to implement edits that is truly optional and falls back cleanly for clients that don't support them directly and don't hurt the protocol very much. Let's think about it and not rush towards defeat.\n","sig":"eb30514d222b3ed83a2b3addd8242abe039d88f43330f1f06a1efba8840ea46ce687f60d582237f28bb88845a65de421d25bdda7eb2cb3d3c125b986722c230b"},"naddr1qqzhx6rpwfjsz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ec8y6tdv9kzumn9wspzq0pcnj8563k2syckwsaruv7wmvwsvx0cw78wwn28yethteazalmlqvzqqqr4gud5304t":{"kind":30023,"id":"4760ce9e333cddc209c5a0295bad5f4ea74716d5cceb548646e250dd5f55be8d","pubkey":"3c389c8f4d46ca81316743a3e33cedb1d0619f8778ee74d47265775e7a2eff7f","created_at":1746046041,"tags":[["d","share"],["title","Share."],["summary","Sharing is social.

No need to dwell for long, but this is another function that goes by half a dozen different names. Repost, renote, retweet, boost, bump, the ubiquitous little repeat button... It's all the same. It doesn't matter what its called, the feature lets you push notes you may find valuable, to the people who follow you. Additionally you also have the \"Quote\" option if you would like to add your own remarks or context. Both of these features are supported by most Nostr microblogging clients and some specialty clients, though some have chosen to exclude one or the other to adhere to a set of guiding principles aimed at helping users to enjoy a healthier social media experience.\n \nSimilar to a quote, you also have the option to copy NoteIDs to paste in other places. They will look like: nevent..., naddr..., or some other possibly foreign looking string prefixed with 'n'  and in some cases the may be preceded by 'nostr:'. These are handy when you'd like to use a note for some other purpose beyond a quote. Perhaps you would like to quote it in a Nostr article or blog entry, or you would like to create a note focusing on a series of notes. Many clients offer easy access to these handy nostr links. If you're finding that the one you are using, does not, then simply hop to another.  This is one of the amazing yet simple uses of Nostr's unique identity and contact list ownership.\n\n### Sharing Note and Profile Links Off of Nostr:\n\nThis is where things get really interesting. If you try to send these 'n' prefixed Nostr links to someone, they will receive that random string and have no clue what to do with it. To solve this, some clever minds came up with [njump.me](https://jump.me/). Just visit that URL and tack your 'n' prefixed event to the end, and boom! you have a link you can send to anyone. Many apps have integrated this feature into their interface to make it easy and convenient to send awesome Nostr content to anyone anywhere, and they can choose which Nostr app they want to use to engage with it right in the landing. Some Nostr clients have traditional link sharing, as well, so you can share links right to the app that you use.\n\n### Helping Your Friends to Get Started:\n\nWe've touched on this a lot in previous posts but in case you missed it:\n[nstart.me](https://nstart.me)\n[hubstr.org](https://hubstr.org)\n[nosta.me](https:/nosta.me)\nThese are all great options to onboarding your friends in a way that allows for them to explore Nostr right out of the gate. You always have the option of creating a keypair in nearly every app around, too. This is easier for some people, depending on how much they want to learn right away, or how they may be using Nostr.\n\nThere's some cool new tools coming out to help even more with getting your friends set up to use Nostr to its fullest capacity. Follow packs, trust attestations, and suggested app packs are all things we look forward to diving into more deeply in the near future.
