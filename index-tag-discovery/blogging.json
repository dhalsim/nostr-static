As sudden as a new block, \u003ca href=\"https://fountain.fm/episode/nfVXIZbxfNbcHyVYA64d\"\u003ethe Lex Friedman Robert Rodriguez interview\u003c/a\u003e, I had an epiphony when he asked Lex, \"Do you consider yourself a creative person?\" I aswered for myself, right away, emphatically yes. I just felt like I never knew what to do with this creative energy. Friedman hesitated and I was like..Wow...He has extreme creativity like Jocko Wilink has extreme disipline. If that guy has doubts, what the hell is stopping me from trying other stuff?\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n      Rodriguez also claimed Four rooms was financial flop. I thought that movie was genius. I had no idea it failed financially. Nevertheless, it was not profitable. His advice was like Tony Robbins for film nerds. I learned about him in a film class I took in college. He was legendary for making a mobie for $7,000. My professor also said it was made for the Mexican VHS market, but I did not know he never sold it to that market. Robert Rodriguez tells the story 100X better, as you might expect a director of his caliber would. His advice hits like Tony Robbins, for film geeks. Here are a few gem quotes from the epiode.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cul\u003e\n      \"Sift through the ashes of your failures\"\n  \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \n  \u003cul\u003e\n      \"Turn chicken shit into chicken salad.\"\n  \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \n  \u003cul\u003e\n      \"Follow your instinct. If it doesn't work, just go. Sometimes you need to slip on the first two rocks, so the key is in the ashes of failure because if I had an insticnt, that means I was on the right track.

I'm just going to commit to making a body of work, a body of work.\"\n  \u003c/ul\u003e\n   \n   \u003cp\u003e\n      Rodriguez taught me what I already know. I am a creative person. I am just a body, punching keys on a keyboard, taking pictures, and semi-vibe-coding art. Maybe this is a shitty blog post today, but I write it anyway. Someone might look at it like I first looked at the math in the Bitcoin white paper and scan it with their eyeballs without really reading or understanding it. Most people on Substack probably don't want to read HTML, but maybe someone will come accross it one day and build something themselves they can find in the ashes of this code.\n   \u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e\n      I once saw Brian Harrington say every bitcoiner is a business owner. If you have a bitcoin address, you can accept bitcoin. How does someone find you though? Are they really going to find your bitcoin address on GitHub? I'd bet 100 sats they won't. Nostr fixes this so I thought about integrating it into my Ghost Blog. I looked at the code injection section and let my muse do the typing. Actually, I let the Duck Duck AI chat do the vibe-coding. As it turns out, you an add a header and footer on Ghost in the code injection. It's just the same HTMl I used to make my MySpace page. \u003cb\u003eThen I thought, what if someone couldn't afford a Start9 or didn't know how to vibe code on Duck Duck Go's free AI chat using Claude? What if, like Rodriguez suggests, I create a business card?\u003c/b\u003e\n   \u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cimg src=\"https://gitea.marc26z.com/marc/Marc26z/raw/commit/6bd1c2e13d520b4b799292296e16e08c7406dd2d/PXL_20250426_184031684~2.jpg\" alt=\"business cards\"\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e\n      \u003cb\u003eYou could just copy my HTML and change my nostr links and pics to go to your nostr links and pics.\u003c/b\u003e You could publish that HTML into https://habla.news.

From a few hundred media uploads to 2500+ a day, now hosting over 1 million unique media items. From a simple, free UI, to advanced personal accounts, NIP98 and NIP96 integration, CDN, redundant load balanced servers with all media backed-up on multiple locations, full integration and automatic uploads with apps like NoStrudel, Damus, Snort.Social, Amethyst, Coracle.Social, Iris.to and more. And of course, none of this is even remotely possible without partnering with a world-class developer, Fishcake.\n\nOriginal           |  Today\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](https://image.nostr.build/bfb55d33e153632fcbff8ac75f2f673475b1eff8ab83ea30db8c67c19f59206a.png)  |  ![](https://image.nostr.build/887129a205a71edde34026d85068eb9ef631f71995437344b97b61ef36a95251.png)\n\n\nBut it's the people that are making this journey special. Everyone with their own unique story. Everyone supporting nostr, supporting each other, helping to build something we all know is special. The amount of support nostr.build has received is unbelievable. From donations to account purchases, troubleshooting and code contributions, I never knew people could be so generous. The generosity amazed me so much, I wrote a [blog about it, here](https://habla.news/u/nostr.build/1685286199879)! \n\nTo hear some of these stories, to drive creativity and use other apps on nostr, to give back a little, we thought to hold a nostr blogging contest, so here it goes!\n\n\n\n\n## How it Works\n\nOn January 1st, 2024 we will post a note calling for blog entries. Contestants will need to respond to the note adding a link to their blog. The blog with the most legitimate 'likes' will be the winner. Rules are below:\n\n- The blog must be written in a nostr blogging app (ex. yakihonne.com, habla.news, blogstack.io, flycat.club)\n- It must contain media (images, gifs, videos). It can be 1-2 images, or 99% mixed media. It does NOT need to be hosted on nostr.build\n- It needs to be a new blog, can't be something from before the contest\n- Anyone can participate\n\n![](https://image.nostr.build/dd29c4ece94179baba5111943dbc70a25cb4e0c72298b355e9d67d8e11a3befa.png)![](https://image.nostr.build/e8407d8bff7191b3f46f792b2fa72e510d7e20f24513b98dd26d69a21f9bac63.png) ![](https://image.nostr.build/f13f85f6fc2103a47f8d9de576984be15ec34ede8dac96472d83317fe2abcd81.png)![](https://image.nostr.build/a660252dcb160a9395662788bde6b0e2ed62d904b32d8eb64de360d9756ee556.png)\n\n\n## Prizes\n\n- 1st Prize will be a Bitcoin hardware wallet of your choice (ex. Coldcard, BitKey, Passport, Jade, Trezor)\n- 2nd Prize will be nostr.build Creators accounts given to two people. If you already have an account, you will get a renewal for the next year.\n- 3rd Prize will be a Bitcoin / Financial / Art book given to three people (ex. Bread, Bitcoin Standard, Broken Money, Fourth Turning)\n\nIn total there are 6 prizes.\n\n## The Goal\n\nThere are a few things we wish to accomplish:\n- Drive adoption of more nostr apps, and the nostr blogging apps are really good\n- Share your stories so we all can hear them. Find out more about what interests people, and to bring out everyone's creative side\n- Drive Bitcoin self custody and cold storage\n\nThat is it! That's the contest. Remember, it can be about anything.\n\nHave fun and 'may the odds be ever in your favor'!\n\n![image](https://image.nostr.build/07f9b8c2c55683e8fc1710ed2123982dbb96a30cad5138fc9243ac5861175ef6.png)\n","sig":"461e008071aa8e4c55216bb23e8748fe6d6148ec946e82f25555480d9790996788cf93b1dca3722bf93f676eed2f4bebecdea4a9e315d3e4d343b6c7e066ce7c"},"naddr1qq24y6j6wg65ycmkwe8yy5z3fum95a6lw3n4zqgkwaehxw309aex2mrp0yhxummnw3ezucnpdejqygrgw8vd7r2ztg4s0mxuxz3m20l6au2dntf9w07p2snff4j54yukcypsgqqqw4rs0gaxhj":{"kind":30023,"id":"7625530a53741fcc97ab29ed27842555dbe66641c586174f5bab8500838ac7b7","pubkey":"6871d8df0d425a2b07ecdc30a3b53ffaef14d9ad2573fc1542694d654a9396c1","created_at":1707766754,"tags":[["client","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["published_at","1707766754"],["d","RjZr5BcvvNBPQO6Zw_tgQ"],["image",""],["title","Embracing a New Chapter: My Journey to CTO of Hoseki"],["summary","Building the foundations for Bitcoin's Financial Future"],["t","blogging"]],"content":"I am thrilled to share the exciting news that I have accepted the role of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [Hoseki](https://hoseki.app), where I will lead their product and engineering teams. For those unfamiliar with Hoseki, we're on a mission to build the infrastructure that bridges the gap between the innovative world of Bitcoin and the established financial system. This new opportunity represents a significant milestone in my career, and I am eager to contribute to Hoseki's ambitious vision.\n\nMy decision to join Hoseki was driven by the company's commitment to what I see as the next phase of Bitcoin. Born out of the desire for a decentralized and censorship-resistant form of money, Bitcoin has evolved from a niche concept to a globally recognized asset with a market capitalization encroaching — and at its peak passing — Silver. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply make it a compelling store of value and hedge against money supply growth, which has attracted the attention of investors, institutions, and even governments. By enabling the seamless integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system, Hoseki is at the forefront of this transformative movement.\n\nWhy is financialization critical now? Accruing Bitcoin is accruing wealth, and we should be able to use this new form of wealth for practical things in society, such as mortgages and loans. Because of its cryptographic nature, Bitcoin already does transparency and auditability natively by default, and because it's digital-first, it _should_ seamlessly be added into existing systems. \n\nIf we do financialization properly, we can bridge the gap between Bitcoin and traditional finance and still adhere to the principles of transparency that Satoshi built Bitcoin to embody. If we can do this seamlessly, we unlock new avenues for adoption, investment, and innovation while avoiding many of the opaque, 'black-box' problems that exist in the banking system today. \n\nThis isn't just about flipping the switch on financialization. It's about building robust, secure, and user-friendly infrastructure that can handle the complexities of both worlds. We need to create a system that is not only comparable to today's but also superior to it. As CTO, my goal is to assemble a top-tier team of engineers who will develop innovative solutions that simplify the intricacies of Bitcoin and make it as user-friendly as the financial products we use every day.\n\nThe journey ahead is exciting, challenging, and brimming with potential. We're entering a pivotal phase in Bitcoin's adoption, and Hoseki is at the forefront, building the foundations that will lead it toward a brighter, more inclusive financial future. As I embark on this new role at Hoseki, I am excited to be at the forefront of this revolution and contribute to building a more inclusive and resilient financial system for future generations.","sig":"c883e812d7d56f0b6dffbf55db97332e2cfdb3ab4842e8df6f5a3de4ebb26973df24f3d8f2a7d1ec8b845f53be1fd9bcdfb04143423012839c6d63d9ce59c9f2"},"naddr1qq24z3zcfdzxsnesd9argn3ewpjnvdnsga44gqgdwaehxw309ahx7uewd3hkcq3qutx00neqgqln72j22kej3ux7803c2k986henvvha4thuwfkper4sxpqqqp65wg7e4xk":{"kind":30023,"id":"8f78a0d75d4560451ff16cd804db5809c09d809e3a156a8624bbfecf1f0db194","pubkey":"e2ccf7cf20403f3f2a4a55b328f0de3be38558a7d5f33632fdaaefc726c1c8eb","created_at":1711212886,"tags":[["client","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["published_at","1711212886"],["d","QDXKDhO0iz4N9pe66pGkT"],["image","https://i.nostr.build/zdDmM.jpg"],["title","Notepress: a minimalist nostr blog reader"],["summary","If you hate frontend frameworks like react and svelte as much as I do, this project is for you."],["t","blogging"],["t","Open Source"]],"content":"*If you hate frontend frameworks like react and svelte as much as I do, this project is for you.*\n\n## Introducing Notepress\n\n#### A vanilla javascript/html blog reader for your long form nostr notes.\n\nIt only does the very basics: it pulls notes from your relays and displays them in a simple, readable format. \n\nYou can view a live demo at https://utxo.one\n\n### Index View with Images and Summaries:\n\n![image](https://i.nostr.build/Aa7ER.jpg)\n\n### Index View with without images and summaries\n\n![image](https://i.nostr.build/oMZ6L.jpg)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are very strongy encouraged and appreciated :) The code is available on github under an MIT licence, do whatever you wish!\n\nhttps://github.com/utxo-one/notepress\n\n## Installation\n\n1.

Not gonna lie, I teared up looking at his confused expression as the lady drag him to the back area of the dog hotel after I checked him in. The state of the world has me really activated these days so I got some comfort food after I dropped him off. Kaido is a pandemic emotional support dog that's used to being around me 24/7 and I'm leaving him with strangers at a local dog hotel while I go change the world in Cuba. This short time apart should be good for both of us, though, because he doesn't get many opportunities to socialize with other dogs other than his sister. I can't wait to pick him up in a couple weeks and take him to the beach. \n\nQuick recap for my followers, **Miguel is headed to Cuba tonight on a delegation with Solidarity Collective to meet with teachers, medical students, social workers, and organizers for a cultural exchange around Pan Africanism in the Latin American context with the aim of building solidarity across the Americas.**   \n\n Questions our delegation will be exploring include:\n\n1. **How do Cubans, a Black-majority country, approach environmental protection, religious syncretism, housing rights, and healthcare?**\n\n2. **What is the role of historic and contemporary abolitionist practices in their quest to eradicate racism?**\n \n3. **What challenges remain to build an equitable society, especially under the yoke of 60 years of the US Blockade?**\n \n4. **What do these lessons mean for the struggle for black liberation in the U.S.?**\n\n\n\nToday I spent time downloading material around Fidel and Che's support of African liberation movements to get up to speed on their experiences in the Congo and Angola. I also reviewed my travel documents to make sure I wasn't missing anything, as well as made contact with my ride to the Martin Luther King Jr Center in Havana. \n\nI packed a random blood pressure cuff that I bought for an EMT course I took (and passed) in junior college to give to the first doctor I meet out there. I'm excited to meet new people and listen to their stories and perspectives on the world. I'm also bringing my rollerblades so I can skate through Havana on my down time! I skated with residents at a night skate event last time I was there in 2017, so I know its a sport that's alive and thriving.\n\nI'm chillin at home right now waiting for my taxi to pick me up in an hour and a half to take me to Rafael Hernandez, where I'll officially embark on the first leg of my journey to Fort Lauderdale where I'll catch my flight to Havana. \n","sig":"03ee74c79e48e6aa91467515024d44088b1a579d3de540425b99055b798ff3c980a4320b957cdb1e37bcfabc8352355a851ce2dc51857f370a9a779d77474b3b"},"naddr1qq25kktwfefhx7nkwqkh2e688qcngdjlx4z5kqgdwaehxw309ahx7uewd3hkcq3qrsvhkyk2nnsyzkmsuaq9h9ms7rkxhn8mtxejkca2l4pvkfpwzepqxpqqqp65w03dfd7":{"kind":30023,"id":"b2040ca694242037449a1922fe93e5605b60e786d7fb7d0f0fa8b538dcd0dfa6","pubkey":"1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642","created_at":1739569095,"tags":[["client","YakiHonne","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["d","KYnNSszvp-ugG8146_5EK"],["image","https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717809072605-YAKIHONNES3.png"],["title","HOW TO INSTALL SERVUS"],["summary","Self-contained CMS, Personal Nostr Relay \u0026 Blossom server"],["published_at","1717809072"],["t","blogging"],["t","Technology"],["t","Nostr"],["t","Make nostr Better"],["t","education"],["t","tutorials"],["t","longform"],["zap","1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642","wss://nostr-01.yakihonne.com","100"]],"content":"Today, I'm going to attempt to install Servus to my test server. I'll be using a raspberry Pi4 4GB version with a 16GB microSD card (because what I have laying around). And, as you know... if it'll run on a Pi, it'll run pretty much anywhere.\n\n**What is SERVUS?**\n\nFrom GitHub... \"Servus is a CMS, personal Nostr relay and personal Blossom server fully self-contained within one executable file.\"\n\n**Here's what you'll need:**\n\nA spare server. It can be a VPS, old laptop, old computer, 3rd market server from a decommissioned datacenter that you got for cheap on Ebay, a NUC... something that can run Linux.\n\n- An understanding of the Linux terminal.\n- install git and cargo.\n- A web browser (don't you side-eye me!).\n \n**Let Us Begin...**\n\nI'm assuming you're using a Debian-based system. Open your terminal and enter the following:\n\nGo ahead and ssh into your server with something like: \"ssh yourusername@ipaddress\" or \"ssh yourusername@domainname.tld\" enter your password when prompted and hit enter.\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808177928-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\nIf you plan to do other stuff with your server later on, you might even consider using \"ssh-copy-id yourusername@ipaddress\" in order to not have to enter you password, all-the-time.\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808237982-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\n(Without the quotes) \"su\", or \"sudo su\". Whatever means you use to get to superuser (root). Then, enter your password.\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808336505-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\nOnce in root, type: *apt install git cargo -y* Then, hit enter.\nYou'll see a wall text... yadda yadda.\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808368003-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808425629-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\nNow, you'll type (without quotes): *\"git clone https://github.com/servuscms/servus.git\"* and hit enter. You'll see a progress bar.\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808448440-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\nIf you type *\"ls\"* you should see a folder labeled, *\"servus\"*. We now change directories by typing, *\"cd servus\"*. Inside of the servus folder you'll see a few other folders and a few files by typing *\"ls\"* again.\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808477332-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\nAccording the the servus github, there are a few build options. I'm going to use the \"release\" version for this tutorial. We do this by typing, *\"cargo build --release\"*. You'll see a fetch progress bar and a wall of text.\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808508541-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808536312-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\n**NOTE: **I'm using a raspberry pi 4, in this tutorial. At the end of trying \"cargo build --release\" I got a version error for a package called \"anstream v0.6.14\" because it requires \"rustc 1.65.0\", or higher. The error message gives you a fix by typing \"cargo update -p anstream@0.6.14 --precise ver\"\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808578125-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\n**BUT that won't work. Here's how to fix it:**\n\nType the following (without quotations): *\"apt purge rustc -y \u0026\u0026 apt install curl -y \u0026\u0026 curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\"*\n\nThis will remove the outdated rustc. Then, you're installing curl so that you can install the latest version of rustc and cargo because they aren't in the distro repo. Restart your machine with: \"sudo reboot\". Once you're back into your servus directory, just run the \"cargo build\" command, again. Now back to the show!\n\nNow that we have run the \"cargo build\" command, it's time to move on to setting up access and ssl. According to github, there are a few options. They are as follows:\n\n- *./target/debug/servus *- this starts Servus on port 4884, without SSL\n\n- *sudo ./target/debug/servus --ssl-acme[-production] --contact-email youremail@example.com*  (this starts Servus on port 443 and obtains SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt using ACME by providing a contact email).\n\n- *sudo ./target/debug/servus --ssl-cert \u003cSSL_CERT_FILE\u003e --ssl-key \u003cSSL_KEY\u003e*  (this starts Servus on port 443 using the provided \u003cSSL_CERT\u003e and \u003cSSL_KEY\u003e)\nI'll be using the command no calling for SSL. More information can be found here: [ https://github.com/servuscms/servus](https://github.com/servuscms/servus)\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808644673-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\nSo from the terminal we input (without quotes): *\"./target/release/servus\"* because, as you may recall, I used the *\"cargo build --release\" *version earlier.\n\nIt will ask a few questions. Here's what I put...\n\n  **Domain: test.local**\n\n  **Admin pubkey: nostr:npub1rsvhkyk2nnsyzkmsuaq9h9ms7rkxhn8mtxejkca2l4pvkfpwzepql3vmtf**\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808690440-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\nThen, you'll get a bit of output with your ip and port interface. In this case, it's http://localhost:4884 Now go to your browser and input that address, it's local, or the IP address of the server... something like, http://192.168.x.x:4884 and HUZZAH!!! Just like that, you should see your site. To get to the admin section of your site, just add \"/.admin\" (without quotes) to the IP address you just input into the browser.\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808748600-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/1c197b12ca9ce0415b70e7405b9770f0ec6bccfb59b32b63aafd42cb242e1642/files/1717808756703-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n\n**CONGRATS!  I  hope this was helpful :-)**\n\nWhile Servus is extremely experimental, and it is advised to not run it in production. There are a number of features worth taking a look at.

The explosion of AI and the ensuing race have made it easy to overlook where the data is coming from. The current model, dominated by big tech players, involves collecting vast amounts of user data and selling it to AI companies for training LLMs. Reddit recently penned a 60 million dollar deal, Google guards and mines Youtube, and more are going this direction. But is that their data to sell? Yes, it's on their platforms, but without the users to generate it, what would they monetize? To me, this practice raises significant ethical questions, as it assumes that user data is a commodity that companies can exploit at will.\n\nThe heart of the issue lies in the ownership of data. Why, in today's digital age, do we not retain ownership of our data? Why can't our data follow us, under our control, to wherever we want to go? These questions echo the broader sentiment that while some in the tech industry — such as the blockchain-first crypto bros — recognize the importance of data ownership, their \"blockchain for everything solutions,\" to me, fall significantly short in execution.\n\nReddit further complicates this with its current move to IPO, which, on the heels of the large data deal, might reinforce the mistaken belief that user-generated data is a corporate asset. Others, no doubt, will follow suit. This underscores the urgent need for a paradigm shift towards recognizing and respecting user data as personal property.\n\nIn my perfect world, the digital landscape would undergo a revolutionary transformation centered around the empowerment and sovereignty of individual data ownership. Platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Yelp, YouTube, and Stack Overflow, integral to our digital lives, would operate on a fundamentally different premise: user-owned data.\n\nIn this envisioned future, data ownership would not just be a concept but a practice, with public and private keys ensuring the authenticity and privacy of individual identities. This model would eliminate the private data silos that currently dominate, where companies profit from selling user data without consent. Instead, data would traverse a decentralized protocol akin to the internet, prioritizing user control and transparency.\n\nThe cornerstone of this world would be a meritocratic digital ecosystem. Success for companies would hinge on their ability to leverage user-owned data to deliver unparalleled value rather than their capacity to gatekeep and monetize information. If a company breaks my trust, I can move to a competitor, and my data, connections, and followers will come with me. This shift would herald an era where consent, privacy, and utility define the digital experience, ensuring that the benefits of technology are equitably distributed and aligned with the users' interests and rights.\n\nThe conversation needs to shift fundamentally. We must challenge this trajectory and advocate for a future where data ownership and privacy are not just ideals but realities. If we continue on our current path without prioritizing individual data rights, the future of digital privacy and autonomy is bleak. Big tech's dominance allows them to treat user data as a commodity, potentially selling and exploiting it without consent. This imbalance has already led to users being cut off from their digital identities and connections when platforms terminate accounts, underscoring the need for a digital ecosystem that empowers user control over data. Without changing direction, we risk a future where our content — and our freedoms by consequence — are controlled by a few powerful entities, threatening our rights and the democratic essence of the digital realm. We must advocate for a shift towards data ownership by individuals to preserve our digital freedoms and democracy.","sig":"6791e9d739ec58b09d47942904505a0d0edc36046be1e850a11099621ca84ab605a3e2eead0702fb26cbf96036a590952de05134084a5e2d866b2229512e95f9"},"naddr1qq2kuwtvdf8x2er0xf88wmn2tagxwcjvw4ykuqgdwaehxw309ahx7uewd3hkcq3qdgu6rp53h53l2xvcn95r7ju4vxkl7hmj2pmshvzkudzqrz84rsvsxpqqqp65wnqqged":{"kind":30023,"id":"155fd4667867e53b0ef76f51836ae415e9d27cec66d7e04b5e898c875ff5e951","pubkey":"6a39a18691bd23f5199899683f4b9561adff5f7250770bb056e3440188f51c19","created_at":1706246052,"tags":[["client","31990:20986fb83e775d96d188ca5c9df10ce6d613e0eb7e5768a0f0b12b37cdac21b3:1700732875747"],["published_at","1706246052"],["d","n9ljNedo2Nwnj_PgbLuIn"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/eca0b19a7b4ba1db07b416ce0efa64abc2e5a5d64dd8986392011b8e7fe3dae6.gif"],["title","A Data Driven Private Publishing Space: Exploring Nostr Markdown Blogging"],["summary","A Data Driven space ,on premise for production ,publishing and content creation around NOSTR and Lightning Payments built on inherent V4V models using Bitcoin as the mechanism to prevent spam, while deploying your own websites, productivity and basically any open sourced infrastructure, to act as a censorship router for payments and the free dissemination of knowledge"],["t","Nostr"],["t","blogging"],["t","sovereign-stack"],["t","v4v"]],"content":"![image](https://image.nostr.build/5aebcc457e4bd18f4254ef094acd4d3c29b424dff668e134e2d0ed58b911c85e.jpg)\n# The Blockchain\n## Bitcoin Blockchain Statistics\n\n| Statistic                       | Value                           |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| # of Blocks Mined               | 827,417 (19,608,856 BTC)        |\n| Days Since Creation (first block)| 5,501 (2009-01-03)               |\n| Size                            | 436.45 GB (+0% today)           |\n| Next Reward Halving             | 2024-04-19                      |\n\n# The World\n## Global Bitcoin Statistics\n\n- Unrestricted in 132 of 257 countries/regions.

Follow [these few simple steps](https://lnshort.it/earn-with-nostr/) to start sending and receiving zaps.\n\nFor creators\n============\n\nMarkdown\n--------\n\nMarkdown is a user-friendly markup language that enables the creation of formatted text using a plain-text editor. It serves as a simple yet powerful tool for specifying the desired formatting of text output. While Markdown itself is not a distinct feature of Habla, the platform fully supports this widely adopted format. As an Habla user, you have the advantage of leveraging Markdown to share beautifully structured posts.\n\n![](https://nostr.build/p/nb9913.png)\n\nTo help you get started, Habla provides a handy toolbar for basic formatting, making it accessible even to those unfamiliar with Markdown. A more detailed explanation of Markdown and examples of its syntax are available [here](https://markdown.land/). Additionally, I'd like to highlight a few particularly interesting elements that you may find useful in your posts.\n\n### Checklists\n\n_You can post checklists by inputting the following:_\n\n```\n\n- [x] Wake up\n\n- [x] Stack sats\n\n- [ ] Go to work\n\n```\n\nHere's what these lists look like for the reader:\n\n- [x] Wake up\n\n- [x] Stack sats\n\n- [ ] Go to work\n\n### Tables\n\nTables help make your posts more illustrative and digestible. Adding a table is as simple as tapping a corresponding button in the toolbar:\n\n![](https://nostr.build/p/nb9914.png)\n\nYou can hover over the icons to see what they offer. \n\n| | Habla | Medium | Substack |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Permissionless monetization | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| Redundancy[^1] | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| Interoperability | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| Popularity | 📈 | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Newsletters | soon™ | ✅ | ✅ |\n\nFootnotes \n---------\n\nFootnotes let you reference relevant information without disrupting the flow of what you're trying to say. Here's how you insert footnotes into your Habla post:\n\n```\n\nSimply add this[^1] symbol where applicable. \nAs you want to add more footnotes, change the number to[^2] and [^3].\n\nProvide references at the end of your article:\n\n[^1]: first reference\n\n[^2]: second reference\n\n[^3]: third reference  \n\n```\n\nHere's how[^2] this will look for the reader[^3].\n\nNostr apps interoperability\n---------------------------\n\nNostr-related links automatically turn into embeds. This is one of the superpowers of Nostr apps - as everything built on Nostr follows the same protocol rules, user experience tends to be more seamless. It's worth noting that there may be exceptions: as some Nostr apps are developed at a higher pace or have first-mover advantage, they may have more features and better compatibility.\n\nHabla takes this to the next level by converting all Nostr-related links into embeds or mentions. By copying a link to any Nostr user or event and pasting it into Habla you will get such reader-friendly results:\n\n-   Mentioning a Nostr user:\n\nnostr:npub107jk7htfv243u0x5ynn43scq9wrxtaasmrwwa8lfu2ydwag6cx2quqncxg\n\n-   Mentioning a long-form post:\n\nnostr:naddr1qqxnzd3cxserxdpsxverzwp4qyvhwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnndehhyapwwdhkx6tpdshszxthwden5te0dehhxarj9ehhwmnnvdskcefwdaexwtcpz9mhxue69uhkummnw3ezuamfdejj7qgmwaehxw309ahx7um5wghx7unpdenk2urfd3kzuer9wchsz9rhwden5te0wfjkcctev93xcefwdaexwtczypl4c26wfzswnlk2vwjxky7dhqjgnaqzqwvdvz3qwz5k3j4grrt46qcyqqq823ccza0tv\n\n-   Embedding a note:\n\nnostr:nevent1qqs8azup6vleusxx2jymsyw5m6mgahyp02va74lxqt2fzkmae0n0s2spqymq4uph68\n\n-   Embedding a badge (can be created and awarded by visiting [https://badges.page](https://badges.page))\n\nnostr:naddr1qq85sctzd3sjqun9wd5kgetww3esygrlts45uj9qa8lv5caydvfumwpy386qyquc6c9zqu9fdr92sxxht5psgqqqw5usef54zg\n\n\u003e All of this can be achieved by simply copying a link to the desired user or event from a search bar of your browser and pasting it into the editor field on Habla.\n\nHere's a post by nostr:npub107jk7htfv243u0x5ynn43scq9wrxtaasmrwwa8lfu2ydwag6cx2quqncxg that is dedicated to reference possibilities of Habla: nostr:naddr1qq98yetxv4ex2mnrv4eszxthwden5te0wfjkccte9eekummjwsh8xmmrd9skctcpzamhxue69uhhyetvv9ujumn0wd68ytnzv9hxgtcpvemhxue69uhkv6tvw3jhytnwdaehgu3wwa5kuef0dec82c33xpshw7ntde4xwdtjx4kxz6nwwg6nxdpn8phxgcmedfukcem3wdexuun5wy6kwunnxsun2a35xfckxdnpwaek5dp409enw0mzwfhkzerrv9ehg0t5wf6k2qg4waehxw309aex2mrp0yhxgctdw4eju6t09uq3zamnwvaz7tmwdaehgu3wwa5kuef0qgs8lft0t45k92c78n2zfe6ccvqzhpn977cd3h8wnl579zxhw5dvr9qrqsqqqa28c8lz2q\n\nLists\n-----\n\nLists are a great way to organize Nostr users into categories to later conveniently access their content. Lists can:\n\n-   be embedded into Habla posts and help you share accounts/events related to a topic you are describing;\n\n-   be a handy tool to have the contacts of people you need quick access to at your fingertips;\n\n-   act as an alternative to your following feed.\n\nLists are very easy to create and manage thanks to [https://listr.lol/](https://listr.lol/) by nostr:npub1zuuajd7u3sx8xu92yav9jwxpr839cs0kc3q6t56vd5u9q033xmhsk6c2uc.\n\nAll you need to do is:\n\n1.  Login to Listr web app with your NIP-07 extension (see guide [here](https://worldtravelambitions.notion.site/How-to-Set-Up-Nostr-Using-GetAlby-and-Snort-social-c3fabb2ecc8d465dba0e73a3f1c2558a))\n\n2.  Tap \"New List\"\n\n3.  Choose the kind you need\n\n4.  Give it a name\n\n5.  Add npubs of people you want to add.\n\nAfter you're done, save the list, find the list you need on your Listr profile page, press \"Copy link\" and paste it into your Habla post. You now have a beautifully integrated list embedded into your article and your readers can easily interact with the mentioned people:\n\nnostr:naddr1qq85sctzd3sjqun9wd5kgetww3esygrlts45uj9qa8lv5caydvfumwpy386qyquc6c9zqu9fdr92sxxht5psgqqqw5cqe8f7jr\n\nEmbedding media from traditional platforms\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhile Nostr is undoubtedly superior to traditional means of communication, many readers aren't yet ready to say goodbye to the YouTubes and Twitters of the world. Habla fixes this by letting you embed traditional social media posts, podcasts, videos and even files.\n\n![](https://nostr.build/i/0b2626ad7d100e7d051d9d6e0be9688e62fad7291cd1b0eeb041ff47c6c606ca.gif)\n\nSimply click the share button on the platform of your choice, choose \"embed\", copy the suggested code and paste it into Habla.\n\n\u003ciframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/hk/podcast/nostrovia-the-nostr-podcast/id1678531266\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe same goes for other traditional platforms: just find the \u003c/\u003e sign in their \"share\" section, copy the provided code and drop it into your Habla post.\n\nEmbedding media from Nostr-based platforms\n------------------------------------------\n\n### Zapstr\n\nEmbedding audio tracks can significantly enrich your posts. Doing so by referring to a Nostr-based app makes the embed ever more convenient for the readers. Arguably, the best Nostr client for audio content is [Zapstr](https://zapstr.live/). Simply copy a link to the Zapstr media file -- be it a song or a podcast episode, and paste it into Habla. Here's an example of a beautiful embed that will appear on your post:\n\nnostr:naddr1qq2hy7ttd3u8saehvsux5em3wa3x67tddparyq3qjk9h2jsa8hjmtm9qlcca942473gnyhuynz5rmgve0dlu6hpeazxqxpqqqpaxj3u2r66\n\n### Zap Stream\n\nThe same goes for video streams. Newly launched [zaps.stream](https://zap.stream/) platform allowing anyone to permissionlessly stream live videos and receive sats directly to their Lightning wallets. Embedding a live stream is just as easy as copy-pasting its link.

You can find out more about the communities on Nostr in my previous guide here:  nostr:naddr1qq8xsetvd3hj6un9v3jxjar0wgq3jamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwdehhxarjd93kstnvv9hxgqgewaehxw309ac82unpwe5kgcfwdehhxarj9ekxzmnyqy2hwumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnfdehhxarp9e3kxqg4waehxw309ahx7um5wghx66tvda6jumr0dsq3vamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwdehhxarj9e3xzmnyqyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2qtxwaehxw309anxjmr5v4ezumn0wd68ytnhd9hx2tmwwp6kyvfsv9mh56mwdfnn2u34d3sk5mnjx5engvecdejxx7t209kxwutnwfh8yar3x4nhyue58y6hvdpjw93nvcthwd4rgdtewvmn7cnjdaskgcmpwd6r6arjw4jsz9nhwden5te0vf5hgcm0d9hx2u3wwdhkx6tpdsq35amnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwdaexzmn8v4cxjmrv9ejx2asprfmhxue69uhhyetvv9ujumn0wd68yurvv438xtnrdaksz8rhwden5te0w4hxjan9wfek2tnwdaehgunfvd5zumrpdejqz8rhwden5te0dehhxarj9ekh2arfdeuhwctvd3jhgtnrdaksz9thwden5te0v4jx2m3wdehhxarj9ekxzmnyqyv8wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnwdaehgunpw35jucm0d5pzql6u9d8y3g8flm9x8frtz0xmsfyf7spq8xxkpgs8p2tge25p346aqvzqqqr4guacv7gv. Meanwhile I'd just like to let you know that you can see what's happening in the themed groups by clicking on the corresponding icon at the top-left corner of your screen:\n\n![](https://nostr.build/i/269e6305093d0c29a7ef5239e55769b02a7a4ca3774a53366e1d2d67a4a34f1c.jpg)\n\nAdditionally, you have the freedom to choose the community where your freshly penned article will land. All you need to do is pick the community that suits your content best from the dropdown menu on the creator's dashboard:\n\n![](https://nostr.build/i/16ef20e3fd561c3d936d413178ddb28f81d53c52f8889388416c429635ad47b4.jpg)  \n\n# The Power of Open Protocols\n\nAs you can see, [Habla](https://habla.news/) and many other apps built on top of Nostr boast a level of flexibility that leaves traditional platforms in the dust. These apps, all speaking the same language, stand on the shoulders of an open, permissionless communications protocol, unlocking possibilities we've never seen before.\n\nBut Habla isn't the only game in town for engaging with long-form posts - it just happens to be the top dog. Other contenders worth a shout-out include [Blogstack](https://blogstack.io/), [Flycat](https://flycat.club/), and [Yakihonne](https://yakihonne.com/). Each brings its unique features to the table. However, in my view, Habla offers the most well-rounded experience for both readers and content creators.\n\nBut here's the beauty of Nostr-based apps: if you ever feel one platform isn't cutting it for you, feel free to hop onto another. Your content, followers, and interactions will follow you wherever you go. After all, you're posting on Nostr and interacting with the Nostr community. Platforms like Habla are just a handy tool to make your interaction with the protocol smooth and straightforward.\n\nJoin the communications revolution now! Be a trailblazer in this exciting development and snag that first-mover advantage. Start building up a follower base of free, sovereign readers who can support you, no matter the national borders or traditional financial system restrictions.\n\nHave questions?

You won't find this name on my driver's licence .  Brutus is not my legal name. Neither is Blogging. I chose to explore life as a nym because nyms are distilled to ideas. You don't n**** eed to focus on my my pronouns nor my ethnicity. Nobody needs my address or a credit card number. Don't need a social security number to be Blogging Bitcoin. You just need to be someone writing a blog about bitcoin. My avatar is my identity. It comes from a bitcoin key which is just a big ass number. Humans translate this big number into a BIP39 mnemonic. Each 4 digits of a big bitcoin number are represented one of 2048 specific words. My avatar is derived from one of those  big random numbers. 1's and 0’s like on and off switches in a double helix. That avatar comes from a paynym. Each feature is calculated and a paynym is generated according to a specific key. You can pay me like magic by sending sats to +softmountain942. Want to know it's really me? All you need to do is send me an amount of sats between 1 and 100,000 sats to +softmountain942. If I can give you the exact number you'll know I am either who I say I am, I am a mind reader, or posess unbelievable luck.\n\nNormies often argue bitcoin has no utility. Who the hell wants to wait ten minutes for a cup of coffee?  Bitcoin uses as much energy as the North Pole. \"You know what bitcoin reminds me of?\"\n\nYou're gonna say \"FUCKIN' TULIPS\" aren't you?\n\n![fucking tulips](https://i.nostr.build/Paxn.jpg)\n\nIt's not their fault. **That's what the news programs them to think**. They never hear about **all the ways you can use bitcoin**, like as an identity more unique than a fingerprint. \n\nI began writing a about bitcoin because I've been obsessed with it since 2014. I want a way to explore my ideas about bitcoin and teach people how to use it. I'm using a psudonym to learn how to use bitcoin like a cypherpunk\n\nMy nym is Blogging Bitcoin. You won't find this name on my driver's **licence**, but I as long as I am the only one in posession of this key, I can prove my digit identity.\n\nI first heard about bitcoin in 2014 on an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience. I fell down the rabbit hole as soon as the  Andreas Antonopolis episode ended. Most people say they first heard about bitcoin in the early days, but dismissd it before they came to see what a powerful new cash system it is.  This was not my experience. I already had one foot hovering the rabbit hole ad the other foot firmly planted on the proverial banana peel. I listened to podcasts anywhere from 4-10 hours a day to **learn as much as I could** while simultaneously **forgetting  the boredom of my fiat job**. I listened to Freakonomics, Dan Carlin's hardcore History and Common Sense, the two plus two poker podcast, and EconTalk back then. I also started reading articles from the Mises Institute before the summer before hearing about bitcoin.\n\n### Why Was I So Interested In Bitcoin in 2014?\n\nI was always nerdy and my high school friends always said I was the biggest rule follower they know. Nowadays, I bet I would have an IEP and be classified somewhere along \"the spectrum.\"  I just think that makes me somewhat of an introvert that likes to do research.  I don't have a diagnosis, but I'm sure I talk to computers better than I talk to people.  For whatever reason, I have noticed many people at bitcoin conferences who have been around before the block size war might also fit this description. My anecdotal evidence suggests brains that work like this have an evolutionary advantage over most people at understanding bitcoin. At least, this is my hypothesis. Right or wrong, people like me tend to like using computers.\n\n## MySpace\n![tom](https://i.nostr.build/WWgR.jpg)\n\nI was always shy with women until I found MySpace.  The history books will call this the first social media, but it was my first dating app.  It allowed me to copy pasta HTML an CSS to do some cool things with my MySpace Page.  I was young and fairly good looking so ended up dating several women I met on the social media platform. At the time, my roommate asked me how I met so many women. I told him about how I met them on MySpace. I was also into things like Napster and BitTorrent. He said I was pretty good at coding and should look into joining the **Cypherpunks Mailing List**. Jullian Assange was on there. For the record,  **I was not good at coding**. I was good at Control  + C and control + V, so I did not join the list. I didn't think I was good enough to join some hacker group like that and although my proclivities made me respect Wikileaks, I wasn't sure it was something I wanted to get tangled up in. On second thought, this was the first touch point I had with cryptography. I dismissed it because I didn't understand it and **as a human I tend to fear the unknown**. This was **a couple years before the bitcoin white paper was released** on the site. I guess that was my first touch point and I dismissed it like most other people. \n\nI would like to think if I had joined the list, I would have found out about bitcoin at the inception. I could have mined some of that early bitcoin when the block reward was 50. I could have been a real OG, but that's not true.  I would have lost it because **I didn't know enough. I would have bought weed on the silk road or threw away a laptop that would one day be worth billions**. Bitcoin has become a lot easier since the early days. There is way more information about it now too.  As the saying goes, you get into bitcoin at the price you deserve. I did not deserve the price of bitcoin on January 3rd, 2009 because I did not understand the importance of public key cryptography in 2007.\n\n## Fractional Reserve Banking\n![It's A Wonderful Life](https://i.nostr.build/6XKq.jpg)\n\nEconomics was my favorite class in High School because I had a great economics teacher, Mr. S. On the first day of class, Mr. S told us his back story. Before becoming a teacher, he and seven of his friends pulled together three million dollars and started a bank. He said you only need three million dollars because of something called fractional reserve banking. When you deposit $100, the bank sets aside that money for you. This is the money in your account you are able to withdraw. This is your money.  The banks don't use that money to give loans out like you might have seen on *It's a Wonderful Life*, No.  The bank gets $900 worth of magic fiat money to loan out to other people. They only need to keep the hundred bucks in the bank. but get to loan out 900 bucks based on your money. New money is created when people pay their loan back with interest. On the other hand, if a borrower defaults on the loan, the money is destroyed.\n\nMy jaw dropped. My dad was unemployed at the time. Our family was struggling. Meanwhile, the banks get money for free, just because? It was obvious **the rich get richer** in this scenario and p**eople who work their ass off for a living get screwed in ways they don't want to be screwed**. I didn't understand why people did not protest this system more often.  Looking back, there was no alternative. My dad cashed his checks at the grocery store. He only used cash. He did side jobs for cash. He didn't keep his money in the bank. I didn't know it at the time, but this had a profound effect on my world view. The problem with paper fiat currency is central banks make it impossible to save. A hundred dollars in 1995 bought a lot more than it does today. If he held on to some of those thirty year old hundred dollar bills, he would have lost much of the purchasing power his blood, sweat, and tears produced. Like I said, The banks get richer and the people who work for a living get screwed.\n\nIt took me six months of study before I sold any fiat for it. Now I want a way to explore my ideas about bitcoin and teach people how to use it. Too many people get caught up watching crypto YouTubers talk about red candles bogus patterns, and other fiat gambling games. I won't talk much about price. I am more interested in many of the cypherpunk ideals designed to propagate freedom around the world .\n\n## Online Poker\n![black friday](https://i.nostr.build/onq5.jpg)\n\nI got into Texas Hold 'Em after watching [Chris MoneyMaker,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Moneymaker) an amateur,  win the 2003 World Series of Poker on ESPN. He was the first person to qualify for the event by playing satellites on PokerStars.com. I played between 25 and 60 hours of poker per week at various times in my life. This was my first rabbit hole, a first intellectual love so to speak. This made me interested in bitcoin for two reasons:\n\n1. I **studied game theory** and calculated Expected Value all the time. **The game theory of bitcoin is phenomenal**. I suspect many of the early poker playing bitcoin adopters recognize this, but it goes beyond the scope of this blog post.\n\n2. [Black Friday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg) taught me an important lesson about trusted-third parties. After the government seized the domains of Poker Stars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker I was lucky enough to have kept most of my bankroll on PokerStars.  They sent me a check within a week. I only had a couple hundred bucks on Full Tilt because the games were softer on stars, but I lied playing the limit hold em sit and goes on full tilt. As it turned out, Full Tilt Poker was a Ponzi Scheme. They commingled player funds. In other words, Full tilt Poker acted like a **fractional reserve bank, but did not get any of the magic fiat money.** So when I tried to cash out my couple hundred bucks, I found out it wasn't there. \n\nI never got my money back from Full Tilt, but it wasn't very much anyway,. It was well worth the lesson. I learned how [Trusted Third Parties Are Security Holes](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/) long before I read Nick Szabo's blogpost about it. This was the catalyst that made me so interested in bitcoin. Andreas said it's money nobody can steal from you so long as you keep can keep 12 words a secret. I also learned there were 25 bitcoin being mined every ten minutes. although I did not understand how at the time, I knew this was the opposite of fractional reserve banking.  I also learned the number was getting cut in half every 4 years. Again, I didn't know how it worked yet and I was a little skeptical, but if true--this solved real world problems I had. Antonopolis said Coinbase was the easiest way to buy it at the time, but if was p2p cash I should be able to get some on the Internet. So I went on Coinbase and created a wallet. I took a screen shot of the QR code and asked for someone to please send me a small amount of bitcoin just so I could see how it worked. A nym gave me $1.50 worth of the stuff and told me to by a cup of coffee with it. He's still around. I downloaded the blockchain.info wallet, wrote down 12 words and took custody of that bitcoin from [ChangeTip.](https://www.changetip.com/)(The service has been discontinued, but you used to be able to use a twitter bot to send bitcoin to people)\n\n![bitcoin](https://i.nostr.build/6mkv.jpg)\n\nI studied bitcoin every day for another five  months sold fiat for some. I stacked a little bit of sats every month. I also learned Dan Carlin accepted it. He asked for a buck a show, so I sent him a dollar worth of bitcoin every week or so.\n\nIn the early days, I used bitcoin as my bankrolll. I would sell some for a couple buy-ins when I had a downswing, but I kept my winnings in bitcoin. I didn't know as much about it back then.  The only books I could find were [Digital Gold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23546676-digital-gold) and [The Age of Cryptocurrency](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22174460-the-age-of-cryptocurrency). I became more interested in it after  after hearing about [Wences Casares's experience of hyperinflation in Argentina](https://www.econtalk.org/wences-casares-on-bitcoin-and-xapo/) as a child.  This was more than a way to get around draconian poker regulations or protect myself from unscrupulous poker sites. **Bitcoin is a way for citizens of the world to protect themselves from absolute tyranny.** \n\n### Why Am I A Nym\n![nym](https://i.nostr.build/Yvxq.jpg)\n\n- Anonymous writing has a long tradition in the US. I chose Brutus becuase it was the nym chosen by the person who wrote my favorite writers of the Anti-Federalist Papers. *I started out with Brutus as my nym*. \n- Satoshi was a nym and showed that it was possible to have a completely peer-to-peer cash system that allows world-wide commerce without any government backed identity attached to it.\n- I was inspired by Rockstar Developer's arguments for becoming a nym and having a funeral for this nym on Citadel Dispatch. *Thankfully, Rockstar has since bee  resurrected on nostr*.\n- I read [this blogpost by K3tan](https://k3tan.com/starting-a-new-digital-identity)\n\nMy goal is to teach people how to become a sovereign individual by building a small audience willing to **pay me 250 sats per week** or 13,000 sats per year. I will also donate 10% of everything I make to [opensats.org](http://opensats.org/?ref=4l2l6ts6mjiybalowepplgfc3df4hahz3vwavi6vnhsidhchmffiw6yd.onion). I realize making a living off donations worth 10 cents is a long shot, but it's something I want to try. I believe the Internet is better if we can avoid the surviellence capitalism that preys upon us all, making us spend more money than we should on things we don't really need.\n\nThe idea is to write about bitcoin everyday and ask for donations. I'm trying something I like to call a reverse paywall to do this. Normallly, a writer provides a small sample of thier article before asking you to pay 50-500 per year to read the rest. Other models include platforms charging subscriptions and paying writers a cut. This model is like a peer-to-peer Patreon. The information is put out there for free. There are no tiers.  The reader is asked to pay the paywall at the end of the article.\n\n## **250 Sats Per Week**\n\nI decided to present my article first and then ask for a small donation at the end of the article. The paywall comes at the end instead of the begining. You are only asked to pay 250 sats at the end of the article. If you can't afford it, you still get to read the article.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.

By using suction to promote circulation and alleviate discomfort, this therapy bridges the gap between age-old healing traditions and contemporary approaches to health and wellness.\n\nCupping in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)\n\nIn TCM, cupping is a therapeutic technique aimed at restoring balance and harmony within the body. According to TCM principles, health issues often arise from stagnation of qi (vital energy) or blood. Cupping is believed to unblock these pathways, promoting the free flow of qi and supporting the body’s natural healing processes.\n\nCommon Uses in TCM:\n\n\t1.\tPain Relief: Cupping is frequently used to treat muscle and joint pain, particularly in conditions like back pain, shoulder stiffness, and arthritis.\n\n\t2.\tImproved Circulation: The suction created by the cups is thought to draw stagnant blood to the surface, improving circulation and oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\n\t3.\tDetoxification: By promoting circulation, cupping is believed to help expel toxins and improve the body’s detoxification processes.\n\n\t4.\tRespiratory Health: TCM practitioners often use cupping to alleviate respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchitis, and the common cold by loosening phlegm and improving lung function.\n\n\t5.\tStress Relief: Cupping can relax tense muscles and promote a sense of calm, reducing stress and anxiety.\n\n![image](https://image.nostr.build/0890676ad4b097f6c6121c75448d7bedd34dffc8e1f1c85eba41cd3094a04e5c.png)\n\n\nCupping in Western Medicine\n\nWestern medicine has approached cupping therapy through the lens of physiological mechanisms and scientific studies. While not universally accepted as a standalone treatment, evidence suggests that cupping may complement conventional therapies for specific conditions.\n\nKey Benefits Acknowledged in Western Medicine:\n\n\t1.\tMuscle Recovery and Pain Management: Studies suggest that cupping can help reduce pain by increasing local blood flow and reducing inflammation. Athletes, in particular, have embraced cupping for recovery and performance enhancement.\n\n\t2.\tReduction in Inflammation: Cupping may help decrease markers of inflammation, potentially benefiting conditions like fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes.\n\n\t3.\tImproved Skin Health: The technique can enhance blood flow to the skin, supporting healing in conditions like acne, eczema, and scars.\n\n\t4.\tRelaxation and Stress Relief: Western researchers note that cupping stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and reducing stress-related symptoms.\n\n\t5.\tSupport for Chronic Illnesses: While more studies are needed, cupping has shown promise as a complementary therapy for migraines, hypertension, and even digestive disorders.\n\n\nTypes of Cupping Therapy\n\n\t1.\tDry Cupping: The most common method, where suction is applied without additional substances.\n\n\t2.\tWet Cupping: Includes controlled skin incisions to promote bloodletting, thought to remove “stagnant” blood in TCM.\n\n\t3.\tFire Cupping: Traditional TCM method using heat to create suction, requiring expertise for safe application.\n\n\t4.\tSilicone Cupping: A modern, flexible alternative for gentler suction, often used in beauty and skin treatments.\n\n\nBridging Eastern and Western Perspectives\n\nWhile TCM emphasizes the energetic and holistic benefits of cupping, Western medicine focuses on its measurable physiological effects. Despite differing frameworks, both perspectives agree on several key benefits:\n\t•\tEnhanced circulation\n\t•\tPain relief\n\t•\tStress reduction\n\nWhen combined with other treatments, cupping can be a valuable tool in a holistic health approach.\n\nConsiderations and Safety\n\nCupping is generally safe when performed by trained professionals. However, individuals with bleeding disorders, skin conditions, or certain medical conditions should consult with a healthcare provider before undergoing therapy. Temporary bruising, a hallmark of cupping, is normal but should not cause concern.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts: Unlocking the Power of Cupping\n\nCupping therapy offers a unique blend of ancient wisdom and modern science, providing a holistic approach to health and wellness. Whether you’re seeking pain relief, improved circulation, or relaxation, this time-tested practice has something to offer.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about how cupping could benefit you, feel free to reach out!

Also, free bitcoin mining, is mining bitcoin free, bitcoin mining free, free bitcoin mining app for android, free bitcoin mining sites are the most searched words and questions.\n\nFree Bitcoin Mining enthusiasts around the world can get it in three main ways. They can buy Bitcoins on a cryptocurrency exchange; accept Bitcoins as payment for goods and services, and through new Bitcoin mining. The process of Free Bitcoin Mining refers to the discovery of new Bitcoins by solving complex mathematical problems.\n\nBitcoin mining is an important part of the bitcoin protocol. Because we can't bring new bitcoin into circulation without bitcoin mining. At the initial stage of bitcoins, Satoshi Nakamoto issued his first block with an ordinary computer. Now mining has become a large-scale industry in which miners use ASIC chips to mine faster and increase their chances of earning more bitcoins in a shorter period.\n\nHow to Start Bitcoin Mining?\nBitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to the public ledger of Bitcoin's past transactions or blockchain. The ledger of these past transactions is called a blockchain since it is a blockchain. The blockchain serves to confirm that transactions to the rest of the network have occurred. Bitcoin nodes use the blockchain to separate legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.\n\n\nBitcoin mining is deliberately designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found by miners every day remains constant. For individual blocks to be considered valid, they must contain proof of work. This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes every time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function.\n\nThe primary purpose of mining is to allow Bitcoin nodes to reach a secure, tamper-proof consensus. Mining is also a mechanism for introducing Bitcoins into the system: miners are paid any transaction fees, as well as a \"subsidy\" of newly created coins. This serves both the purpose of decentralized distribution of new coins and motivating people to provide security for the system through mining.","sig":"e67c4b53e8143b67f5b6d6ce3d426c367dfafffcc6a26026bf6c0c0f3bbe00acedc098722bd2a6c92a9dbe59c4b111596b17d6e25fc7c1ba3f5a3fff5f24844b"},"naddr1qqgxxe3kx4jr2c3sv5cnqdfnx9nrjqgdwaehxw309ahx7uewd3hkcq3qn3rmk5g03eej40rg2x83azxnml879lxxynxegfawl36e6qqrs8gqxpqqqp65wr089yr":{"kind":30023,"id":"0407a86f645e8ce98374b409a146280967125cb4b8d294718fd89decdef8c3a9","pubkey":"9c47bb510f8e732abc68518f1e88d3dfcfe2fcc624cd9427aefc759d000381d0","created_at":1732475982,"tags":[["client","YakiHonne","YakiHonne"],["d","cf65d5b0e10531f9"],["image","https://image.nostr.build/69d12e642fc01efb70e6001803c824e61695274c58ae07895ff642e3a8783da0.jpg"],["title","How Blockchain Technology, Led by Bitcoin, Will Revolutionize the Next Several Decades\n"],["summary",""],["published_at","1732475982"],["t","Bitcoin"],["t","blockchain"],["t","blogging"],["t","Technology"],["t","Tech"],["t","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"],["t","#nostr"],["t","Future"],["t","Real estate"],["t","Social Media"],["t","Media"],["t","#medicine"],["t","Evolution"]],"content":"Blockchain technology, particularly the Bitcoin blockchain, is poised to redefine the way we think about trust, ownership, and value in society. Its decentralized, transparent, and immutable nature sets the stage for a wave of innovation that will reshape industries, governance, and everyday life. While Bitcoin is most famously known as a digital currency, its underlying blockchain technology offers transformative potential far beyond finance. Let’s dive into how this technology could revolutionize the coming decades, from small-scale applications to global systemic change.\n\n1. Financial Inclusion and Empowerment\n\nOne of the most immediate impacts of blockchain technology is its ability to empower individuals who have been excluded from traditional financial systems. Over 1.4 billion adults globally remain unbanked, unable to access basic financial services due to lack of identification, credit history, or proximity to banks. Bitcoin’s blockchain offers a decentralized alternative.\n\nWith just a smartphone and internet access, anyone can participate in a global financial network. Peer-to-peer transactions eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and enabling borderless payments. This is particularly impactful in developing nations, where remittance fees from services like Western Union often consume a significant portion of the money sent home by workers abroad.\n\n2. Redefining Property and Ownership\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain introduces a new era of digital ownership. By using public and private keys, individuals can prove ownership of assets without needing third parties. This concept extends beyond Bitcoin to include:\n\t•\tTokenized Real Estate: Fractional ownership of property becomes possible, making investments accessible to more people.\n\t•\tIntellectual Property: Artists and creators can mint their work as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), securing royalties and ownership rights without intermediaries.\n\t•\tSupply Chain Transparency: Blockchain ensures the authenticity of goods by tracking their journey from origin to consumer, revolutionizing industries like food safety, luxury goods, and pharmaceuticals.\n\n3. Revolutionizing Governance\n\nBlockchain’s transparency and immutability make it a powerful tool for improving governance and reducing corruption. Imagine a world where:\n\t•\tVoting: Elections are conducted on blockchain platforms, ensuring transparency and eliminating fraud. Citizens can verify their votes without compromising privacy.\n\t•\tPublic Funds: Governments manage budgets and distribute aid using blockchain, providing real-time accountability for how tax dollars are spent.\n\t•\tSmart Contracts: Agreements are executed automatically when pre-defined conditions are met, removing bureaucratic delays and reducing legal disputes.\n\nFor example, countries experimenting with blockchain for land registries are reducing disputes over property rights while fostering economic stability.\n\n4. The Internet of Value\n\nThe internet revolutionized how we share information; blockchain is set to revolutionize how we exchange value. Bitcoin’s blockchain introduced the concept of digital scarcity—an asset that cannot be duplicated or counterfeited. This is the foundation of a new Internet of Value:\n\t•\tMicropayments: Services like podcasts, articles, or software can be monetized with tiny payments using the Lightning Network on Bitcoin, bypassing traditional subscription models.\n\t•\tDecentralized Finance (DeFi): Borrowing, lending, and saving can occur directly on blockchain platforms, offering alternatives to traditional banks with reduced fees and greater accessibility.\n\t•\tGlobal Trade: Blockchain enables faster, cheaper cross-border payments, reducing friction in global commerce and empowering small businesses to compete on a global scale.\n\n5. Revolutionizing Healthcare\n\nBlockchain can revolutionize healthcare by improving data management and patient empowerment:\n\t•\tMedical Records: Patients can securely store and share their medical histories, ensuring accurate diagnosis and treatment while maintaining privacy.\n\t•\tDrug Authentication: Blockchain can track pharmaceuticals from production to patient, reducing counterfeit drugs.\n\t•\tResearch Collaboration: Blockchain enables secure sharing of anonymized patient data among researchers, accelerating breakthroughs in medicine.\n\nFor example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, blockchain was explored as a way to verify vaccination records and ensure the integrity of supply chains for vaccines.\n\n6. Energy and Environmental Solutions\n\nThe energy sector stands to benefit significantly from blockchain technology:\n\t•\tDecentralized Energy Grids: Households with solar panels can trade excess energy with neighbors using blockchain-based platforms, fostering community-driven energy networks.\n\t•\tCarbon Credits: Blockchain ensures transparency in carbon credit trading, preventing fraud and incentivizing companies to reduce emissions.\n\t•\tTracking Sustainability: Blockchain enables tracking of sustainable practices, from renewable energy usage to ethical sourcing of materials.\n\n7. Education and Credentialing\n\nBlockchain can solve problems of credential verification and access to education:\n\t•\tDigital Diplomas: Educational institutions can issue tamper-proof certificates on a blockchain, streamlining job applications and international recognition of qualifications.\n\t•\tLifelong Learning: Blockchain can track an individual’s learning journey across multiple institutions, enabling personalized education pathways and skills validation.\n\nThe Larger Vision: A Decentralized Future\n\nAt its core, blockchain is about decentralization—removing the need for trust in intermediaries and empowering individuals. This has profound implications for:\n\t•\tFreedom and Sovereignty: Bitcoin’s blockchain allows individuals to store and transfer value without fear of censorship, making it a tool for human rights in oppressive regimes.\n\t•\tResilient Economies: Decentralized systems are less vulnerable to single points of failure, fostering robust economies and networks.\n\t•\tGlobal Collaboration: Blockchain can create a new era of cooperation, where value and ideas flow freely across borders without interference.\n\nChallenges and the Road Ahead\n\nWhile the potential of blockchain is enormous, challenges remain:\n\t•\tScalability: Current blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, must continue to innovate to handle growing demand.\n\t•\tRegulation: Governments must balance innovation with oversight, ensuring blockchain is used responsibly without stifling growth.\n\t•\tAdoption: Educating the public and creating user-friendly interfaces are critical for mainstream adoption.\n\nDespite these challenges, the trajectory is clear: blockchain is not a passing trend but a foundational technology that will shape the next several decades.\n\nThe Role of Bitcoin in Leading the Revolution\n\nBitcoin, as the first and most secure blockchain, will continue to lead this revolution. Its decentralized nature, proven security, and global recognition position it as the backbone of this transformation. While other blockchains may serve specialized purposes, Bitcoin’s role as digital gold and a store of value ensures its enduring relevance.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain’s influence will extend far beyond currency. It is the blueprint for how trust, ownership, and value can exist in a digital age—transparent, immutable, and accessible to all.\n\nAs we look to the future, blockchain technology represents not just a technological revolution but a societal shift toward empowerment, transparency, and decentralization. From small changes in everyday transactions to large-scale systemic transformation, blockchain has the potential to touch every aspect of our lives, ushering in a more equitable and connected world.","sig":"f407ea5cef460641055fafa4fcf3ec01aa7d3b7ac74a9438d1501b66514adcb75d2b405d434df30f3d6833b9a4e1d49b4678972303b0722020d523a786d2e5bb"},"naddr1qqj9xmmdv5k5jmnnd9nksarn94skuepd2fjkvmr9vd6xjmmwwvkkyc34v3cxsqgdwaehxw309ahx7uewd3hkcq3q9aw7qqpahp8v64zfz2p4p3nv07mra8gzkfgdsjhcfarrutumemcsxpqqqp65wx7efey":{"kind":30023,"id":"dab5ea812133a9d525b40f0b0b6ff6df23e0796971be7c9dd36986700e9e6b97","pubkey":"2f5de0003db84ecd5449128350c66c7fb63e9d02b250d84af84f463e2f9bcef1","created_at":1734281093,"tags":[["title","Some Insights and Reflections"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/10e3e8dcc1cc4dd275ffb6d8334a300eeb20559fe7fa7563daa0c43e228aaadc.jpg"],["t","Nostr"],["t","freedom"],["t","permission"],["t","slavery"],["t","bitcoin"],["t","blogging"],["t","centralization"],["t","censorship"],["published_at","1734281093"],["d","Some-Insights-and-Reflections-bb5dph"]],"content":"This Week I immersed myself in Bitcoin from multiple angles-technical, societal and personal. The journey included a marathon 32-hours of listening to [Rabbit Hole Recap (RHR)](https://fountain.fm/show/VDaMppQRUBZioj2XkaLn), an essential resource for Bitcoin insights. It's worth noting that I started from the begining and plan to make my way through the whole catalogue. Marty and Matt's timestamps, along with contributions from their guests, served as my roadmap. Using Fountain to stream, I also streamed sats-a small but extraordinary feature that allows users to stacks sats while compensating cretors directly through fractional donations.\n\n## Revisiting Speculative Attack by Pierre Rochard (2014)\n\nNow that [*Speculative Attack Season 2*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack-season-2/) *(which I've not read yet)* has been released. I took the time to read Pierre Rochards influential essay, [*Speculative Attack*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/) and reflected on its timeless insights. Rochard argues that Bitcoin adoption isn't dependent on technological advancements or consumer preferences, but on economic realities. As fiat currencies weaken, Bitcoin won't enter the mainstream by persuasion but by necessity.\n\nCritics continue to underestimate Bitcoin's inevitability due to their fiat biases and lack of financial insight. This year alone, mainstream media has been compelled to discuss Bitcoin-notably to Trump's endorsement of 'crypto.' Despite their attempts to shape narratives to suit their ideal visions, they've had no choice but to engage with Bitcoin's growing influence.\\\n\\\nAs Parker aptly puts it 'Gradually, The Suddenly'\n\n## Wassabi Wallet and the Privacy Imperative\n\nAn RHR interview (from early in the catalogue) with guest Adam Ficsor, CTO and Co-founder of Wassabi Wallet, sparked a deeper consideration of my digital footprint. Like many, I've spent years online neglecting privacy in favour of convenience. The discussion on CoinJoins reminded me of the importance of prioritising privacy, not just romanticising it. \n\nImproving operational security (opsec) is now a personal focus. Resources like Jameson's *Cypherpunk Cogitations* and the Bitcoin Optech newsletter offer valuable guidance. While I've exercised caution, I recognise a need to address my laziness with opsec and take meaningful steps to protect my privacy. Time will reveal the results of these efforts.\n\n## Caribbean Slavery amd Centralised Platforms\n\nWhile exploring historical systems of control, I delved into the brutal realities of [New World slavery in the British Caribbean](https://aeon.co/ideas/how-did-slaveholders-in-the-caribbean-maintain-control). Enslaved elites, like drivers, were granted limited privileges to maintain order, creating divisions within the community. This divide-and-rule strategy highlights the fragility of oppressive frameworks, which began to crumble with events like the Hatian Revolution and humanitarian activism.\n\nInterestingly, similar dynamics are visible with centralised plaforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Verified accounts (the \"blue checks\") act as mordern day 'elites' with perceived freedoms. However, their autonomy is limited by the platforms centralised authority. Challenging the rules risks censorship and cancellation, proving their freedom is an illusion subject to the will of their overseers. Enhancing the argument further for protocols like Nostr to help people win back their freedoms.","sig":"8b1d4ef0f92361dfe6b5651500cd4217db87e7a9e5ec7aa8cb5db1fd0c5b445795851dfa9c6cb9ec47e493e9583458ecc686222fdd9c583e1a0d5d8e6426507f"},"naddr1qqm9w6rpwskkje3dt9hh2u3d2phhyarxdakxjmedf9ej6strw36kzmrv0yk4qun9w368jt28wfjkzapdv3mkywttxyq3vamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwwpexjmtpdshxuet5qgsrr9advrdchnverna7qgcfd2gu375fjd7rtcwmu03fd94t0gfzh9grqsqqqa28waprqq":{"kind":30023,"id":"5c33a00e52c86188a69f1159ea50633846800c5dc1441fd9a582cfd0ae13dd91","pubkey":"3197ad60db8bcd991cfbe023096a91c8fa89937c35e1dbe3e29696ab7a122b95","created_at":1741982401,"tags":[["title","What if Your Portfolio Is Actually Pretty Great?"],["summary","Even Without the Jellyfish"],["image","https://blossom.primal.net/06f18fb9aab21c555bae82ce177c38cd1ce0d0b131c9824aeef94c84d094053c.jpg"],["t","artstr"],["t","art"],["t","illustration"],["t","social"],["t","blogging"],["published_at","1741982401"],["d","What-if-Your-Portfolio-Is-Actually-Pretty-Great-dwb9k1"]],"content":"I’m working on my portfolio.

Wouldn’t that be wonderful?\n\nInstead, it slowly and quietly became a litany of the “could”s and “should”s and “must ”s: I could include all the work that’s even remotely relevant, I should probably showcase a range of skills, and therefore I must create a bunch of completely new work to appeal to every possible audience.\n\nMaybe I need a range of deep, magical forest backgrounds, or a unicorn flying over a London night sky, or a coral reef with jellyfish playing poker, painted in very bright colours.

I was looking for something specific, a texture or a colour from a sketch that I’ve done.

After all, I’ve been drawing daily since last July, sometimes from life, sometimes from imagination. Inevitably, I created a lot of work: paintings, drawings, sketches, and finished illustrations. Only looking through my work did I realise that I will always feel the push to make more work for my portfolio; because my style keeps evolving, I’m able to draw more and better with every step. But is the work I’ve done so far, enough to show where I am as an illustrator? Hell yeah.\n\nMany cliches come to mind (because they’re true!) but my favourite is: don’t compare yourself to others, only compare to yourself from the past.\n\nThis is the third year of me going to Bologna for the fair, and the first time I will bring a portfolio with me. That means whatever I do is already 100% more than what I’ve done before. That’s a much better way to think about it.\n\nChill, Martyna, you’ve got this.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nx\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/f2c43a504599d683b40b05a46ce988eecb84bfb7325c36473ed58b7bcf583fe9.png\"\u003e","sig":"a377fff13060387bfa8c268c8243fea836e993dfbbeeaa53cbf1c571ef6289456766d5922be06cf135b1a846772ce05f217355099bf7c61feb78bc8d317324fa"},"naddr1qqn8xmedd3hkueedwd6kyum5v93kkttgv4kxcmedva5x7um594mkjarg94axzurnqyxhwumn8ghj7mn0wvhxcmmvqgsd73u9dpremcntf2pur0wymw4krdwvsts6xyhzk29us9dp9223uecrqsqqqa28un2s5s":{"kind":30023,"id":"bd3f6534965f8a0f20fdcb6991e8d113a6114b8993f3f63c42fb9bd909de4e7a","pubkey":"df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67","created_at":1745348198,"tags":[["d","so-long-substack-hello-ghost-with-zaps"],["title","So Long Substack, Hello Ghost With Zaps"],["summary","I write about why I decided to leave Substack and start posting my blogs on Ghost instead because I learned how to integrate nostr into my Ghost blog for payments and paid subscriptions."],["published_at","1745346365"],["published_at","1745346365"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzph68s45y080zdd9g8sdacnd6kcd4ejpwrgcju2eghjq45y4f28n8qqn8xmedd3hkueedwd6kyum5v93kkttgv4kxcmedva5x7um594mkjarg94axzurn7krwu6"],["p","df478568479de26b4a83c1bdc4dbab61b5cc82e1a312e2b28bc815a12a951e67"],["e","b470d1ab5213e2355d6c326f64473d29ca00dea01b7ba72cd29b1807a8c2353d","","mention"],["t","ghost"],["t","blogging"],["t","newsletter"],["t","substack"],["t","writing"],["t","self-hosting"],["t","nostr"],["t","nostr integration"],["image","http://p66dxywd2xpyyrdfxwilqcxmchmfw2ixmn2vm74q3atf22du7qmkihyd.onion/content/images/2025/04/marcPhoto.png"],["published_at","1745346365"]],"content":"*\"It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.

While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time. Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms. Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.*\n--Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin Talk-- August 5, 2010\n\nI very be coded  some HTML buttons using Claude and uploaded it to https://github.com/GhostZaps/ It's just a button that links to zapper.fun.\n\n\nI signed up for Substack to build an email address, but learned adding different payment options to Substack is against their terms and services. Since I write about nostr, these terms seem as silly as someone saying Craig Wright is Satoshi. It's easy to build an audience on Substack however, or so I thought. Why is it easier to build an audience on Subtack though? Because Substack is a platform that markets to writers. Anyone with a ~~pen~~ ~~keyboard~~ smartphone and an email can create an account with Substack. There's just one problem: You are an Internet serf, working the land for your Internet landlord--The Duke of Substack.\n\n\nThen I saw that [Shawn posted about Substack's UX](nostr:nevent1qqstgux34dfp8c34t4krymmygu7jnjsqm6spk7a89nffkxq84rpr20gt96uaf). \n\n![Shawn Post](https://gitea.marc26z.com/marc/Marc26z/raw/commit/e65733bda9b6cf42083cb9c9d4e51ff8118c5850/publicSpech1.png)\n\nI should have grabbed my reading glasses before pushing the post button, but it occurred to me that I could use Ghost to do this and there is probably a way to hack it to accept bitcoin payments over the lightning network and host it yourself. So I spun my noddle, doodled some plans...And then it hit me. Ghost allows for markdown and HTML. I learned HTML and CSS with free-code camp, but ain't nobody got time to type CSS so I vibe-coded a button that ~~baits~~ sends the clicker to my zapper.fun page. This can be used on any blog that allows you to paste html into it so I added it to my Ghost blog self-hosted on a Start 9. The blog is on TOR at http://p66dxywd2xpyyrdfxwilqcxmchmfw2ixmn2vm74q3atf22du7qmkihyd.onion/, but most people around me have been conditioned to fear the dark web so I used the [cloudflared](https://github.com/remcoros/cloudflared-startos) to host my newsletter on the clear net at https://marc26z.com/ \n\n## Integrating Nostr Into My Self-Hosted Ghost Newsletter\n\nI would venture to say I am more technical than the average person and I know HTML, but my CSS is fuzzy. I also know how to print(\"Hello world!\") in python, but I an NPC beyond the basics. Nevertheless, I found that I know enough to make a button. I can't code well enough to create my own nostr long-form client and create plugins for ghost that send lightning payments to lighting channel, but I know enough about nostr to know that I don't need to. That's why nostr is so F@#%-ing cool! It's all connected.\n**\n- One button takes you to zapper.fun  where you can zap anywhere between 1 and ,000,000 sats.**\n- Another button sends you to a zap planner pre-set to send 5,000 sats to the author per month using nostr.\n- Yet another button sends you to a zap planner preset to send 2,500 sats per month.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. I entered a link that takes the clicker to my [Shopstr Merch Store](nostr:npub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0). The point is to write as self-sovereign as possible. I might need to change my lightning address when stuff breaks every now and then, but I like the idea of busking for sats by writing on the Internet using the Value 4 Value model. I dislike ads, but I also want people to buy stuff from people I do business with because I want to promote using bitcoin as peer-to-peer electronic cash, not NGU porn. I'm not prude. I enjoy looking at the price displayed on my BlockClock micro every now and then, but I am not an NGU porn addict.\n\nThis line made this pattern, that line made this pattern. All that Bolinger Bart Simpson bullshit has nothing to with bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It is the musings of a population trapped in the fiat mind-set. Bitcoin is permissionless so I realized I was bieng a hipocryte by using a permissioned payment system becaue it was easier than writing a little vibe code. I don't need permission to write for sats. I don't need to give my bank account number to Substack. I don't need to pay a 10$ vig to publish on a  a platform which is not designed for stacking sats. I can write on Ghost and integrate clients that already exist in the multi-nostr-verse.\n\n### Nostr Payment Buttons\n\nThe buttons can be fouund at https://github.com/Marc26z/GhostZapButton\n\nYou can use them yourself. Just replace my npub with your npub or add any other link you want. It doesn't technically need to be a nostr link. It can be anything. I have a link to another Ghost article with other buttons that lead down different sat pledging amounts. It's early. Everyone who spends bitcoin is on nostr and nostr is small, but growing community. I want to be part of this community. I want to find other writers on nostr and stay away from Substack. \n\n\u003cstyle\u003e\n  .zap-button {\n    background: linear-gradient(to right, orange, purple);\n    color: white;\n    padding: 10px 20px;\n    border: 2px solid purple;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    display: block;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n  }\n\u003c/style\u003e\n\u003c!--change \"npub1marc26z8nh...\" to your npub  --\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://marc26z.com/support-my-work-by-subscribing-5-000-sats-per-month/\"\u003e\n  \u003cbutton class=\"zap-button\"\u003eSupport By Pledging 5,000 Sats Per Month\u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\n\nHere's what it looks like on Ghost: https://marc26z.com/zaps-on-ghost/\n\nnpub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0","sig":"66231301392312cbfd9d65396be29a02577633bbbaa7681d7f7a10ad65434d97b966cc6c6672f42596ee677dcf9bc5dc1a89d91259fd3603f14e8564ac6cf464"},"naddr1qqvhxarpvd4kjmn894ekzarn94hkuttnw438xarpvd4szrthwden5te0dehhxtnvdakqygr4hu34xxhflxxx9x2m5pcereygat28t96nw8tr6l0ag677r0agj5psgqqqw4rsvs22lq":{"kind":30023,"id":"1ad53f4cb0eb57b6d9508c75c9fadda09c50ed80211dddeb741f9a52ceb65ecf","pubkey":"75bf23531ae9f98c62995ba07191e488ead475975371d63d7dfd46bde1bfa895","created_at":1704400636,"tags":[["d","stacking-sats-on-substack"],["title","Stacking Sats on Substack"],["summary","My plan on how to write on substack and use bitcoin and nostr for payment subscriptios instead of Stripe."],["published_at","1704398476"],["t","blogging"],["t","substack"],["t","grownostr"],["image","https://i.nostr.build/jd95.png"],["alt","This is a long form article, you can read it in https://habla.news/a/naddr1qqvhxarpvd4kjmn894ekzarn94hkuttnw438xarpvd4sygr4hu34xxhflxxx9x2m5pcereygat28t96nw8tr6l0ag677r0agj5psgqqqw4rswndjq6"],["client","31990:7d4e04503ab26615dd5f29ec08b52943cbe5f17bacc3012b26220caa232ab14c:1687329691033","wss://relay.nostr.band","web"],["e","8206f07920aedee650cc4d192e07d97f897a7c59ce5f22ac30315f5d289a2376","wss://nos.lol/","mention"],["p","75bf23531ae9f98c62995ba07191e488ead475975371d63d7dfd46bde1bfa895"]],"content":"# Stacking Sats on Substack\n\n\nI’ve been writing this blog for almost two years now. I fell down the nostr rabbit hole shortly after and began focusing much of my time and energy learning about all these cool new things we can do with this new protocol. I’ve also been trying to figure out how to use Asyncio and AstroBlog to cross post blogs on Astro Blog to Habla.news. I have a friend who is trying to help me, but the nostr has changed so much, it’s hard to keep up with it all. The advantage of this would be that it’s easier to optimize SEO, I think. I’m not really well versed in the keyword universe and all that.\n\n \nI also talked to the developer of the Orange Pill App and asked him if he could integrate nostr more into the app. He told me to look at the stats. He doesn’t think there’s enough people to make it economically viable. I wanted to argue with him, but I ran the numbers. He’s not wrong. It felt like a slap to the face, but I needed that so I would like to thank him.\n\nI asked myself, “Blog, how the hell do you expect anyone to read your blog when you are only visible to such a small subset of a small online community?” This is a problem, but problems are an opportunity. I also heard Whitney Web talk about how email lists are good to have because they are censorship resistant. That way if your twitter account get’s banned, you don’t lose your audience. So I decided to start posting my blog on Substack again, because Whitney makes a great point that I never thought about before. Here I am spending all this time posting NIP26, kind 30023 long-form posts on nostr, but I’m not using email. \n\n\n## Stacking on Substack\n\n![button format](https://i.nostr.build/8ZP4.png)\n\nSo I decided to use Substack again because it has a built in email subscribe button. They also have a fiat subscription service which means they market to people who are willing to pay for writers words. So I decided to sign up, give them my bank account information, fingerprints, and social security number.  Just kidding. I’m using the service to transmit my blog over simple mail transfer protocol again,. I still have some kinks to work out, but here are some of my ideas.\n\nI also can create custom buttons on Substack. I will use this to grow nostr and add links to zaps, BTCpayServer and nostr store. You can do the same by following the example in the photo above.\n\nThe buttons look like this to the reader\n\n![buttons](https://i.nostr.build/jd95.png)\n\nTo see how they work, hit the subscibe button and you'll get the email sent to your inbox\n\n\n### My Substack Plan\n\nPost a blog on nostr twice a week. Cross Post it to substack. I am also open to suggestions. I would prefer a platform that allows me to use markdown and an API, but I need to do more research.\n\nOn Substack:\n\nInclude a [zapping link](nostr:nevent1qqsgyphs0ys2ahhx2rxy6xfwqlvhlzt603vuuhez4scrzh6a9zdzxasppemhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mp0qgs8t0er2vdwn7vvv2v4hgr3j8jg36k5wkt4xuwk847l634auxl639grqsqqqqqpa6etnt)\n\nInclude a [shopping link](https://plebeian.market/p/b9680763f7af15c7ee848a06cc32bd643c37e986529444f2697254b741dd87ad/stall/2e29901dea521baa35a2d93e5970f8ed72449a26df7978cb1c9234efbd0b02fa)\n\nInclude a link asking people to highlight their favorite part of the blog in[highlighter.com](https://highlighter.com).\n\nInclude A link to What I call [Value 4 Value Ads](https://habla.news/u/blog\\@bloggingbitcoin.store/shop-the-bitcoin-circular-economy).

That doesn’t mean I’m off to the races. I still intend to take the whole month (or as long as it takes, really) to make plans and carefully set a course forward. I’m not rushing it, I’m letting it all set, like tea leaves at the bottom of a glass.\n\nI still draw daily (I’m around day 193 now), but the nature of the drawing seems to have changed. Instead of using colours and taking time to capture light and mood, I only seem to be interested in quick line sketches, the quicker, the better.\n\nThey go well with being slightly absent-minded, which I am, in a nice way. Instead of looking around for inspiration, I turn to the books I’m reading and just sketch scenes that stay with me.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/8283613572a73701762a413e957ac5978c08da17369c79642c91aa529ad3249d.jpg\"\u003e\n\nAll drawings in this post are based on The Book of Doors by Gareth Brown, one of the many tasty books I was gifted for Christmas. I’m adding the sketches in the order they were made because it’s kind of funny how the characters emerge. I didn’t plan for the main character to have short light hair, but somehow she does.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/6fb4f3a8e02c40da29e342375b9b89667b59986c8c4ce14cd22f1ad1a81b8115.jpg\"\u003e\n\nThe book lends itself perfectly to easy sketching; the characters are not very complicated, but they are described with a lot of visual clues, and the story moves from location to location, leaving clear images in my mind.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/1b56b76a492961d35e89c205fbcc7c34a77ca47f2292591b25d5c3053f0bcc4a.jpg\"\u003e\n\nIt’s pretty clear who’s the bad guy and who’s not, and it was a good exercise to try to show that in a sketch. There is also a lot of movement in the story, with characters being surprised by the events and having to run/ hide/ escape and confront each other.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/ade023f1dd395ac9430da00aa1126901a4281b696a5e552973ae1ab65ffffcb4.jpg\"\u003e\n\nThere are a lot of doors, many different locations and a good dose of time travelling. I don’t think I ever drew a time-travelling kind of scene before, so of course, I had to try. I used the hairstyle, a piece of clothing and a bit of colour to show the same person at two points in time but also in the same room. Did it work?\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://blossom.primal.net/89ab51a62b9f3de730bcb69e3e1f199b928cd3f47e23193c83adc583bf481ede.jpg\"\u003e\n\nRecently, I’ve been really into the black and white illustrations in young adult, early reader, and chapter books. I love their simplicity and how much they can convey with a line drawing. I will hang around in that space for a bit, with my quick sketches.\n\nI started a new book, funnily enough also about doors, so I might share more sketches soon.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nx\n\nM","sig":"1130d85da2262521504ac59189c276c8828623235bcd403db484ae9f924a15335be27eb12d107f6d77c3785c587788ab441f5b7acd4d85ed8f777053c0c3c3ac"},"naddr1qqx8qatzd35hx6r9vskkzaqpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mqzypl62m6ad932k83u6sjwwkxrqq4cve0hkrvdem5la83g34m4rtqegqcyqqq823c0fy0z4":{"kind":30023,"id":"35a1f957c9058522afc9e6d1686e9ad0e7b2fe1d1c717fa722a3504f6de4f996","pubkey":"7fa56f5d6962ab1e3cd424e758c3002b8665f7b0d8dcee9fe9e288d7751ac194","created_at":1695546645,"tags":[["d","published-at"],["title","Migrating content to nostr"],["summary","Habla allows setting published dates"],["published_at","1694901600"],["t","nip-23"],["t","nostr"],["t","blogging"],["image","https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63c880de767a987f902e30db/644b7931ae427d2259b834ba_art-deco-cat.png"],["zap","7fa56f5d6962ab1e3cd424e758c3002b8665f7b0d8dcee9fe9e288d7751ac194","wss://purplepag.es","90"],["zap","4918eb332a41b71ba9a74b1dc64276cfff592e55107b93baae38af3520e55975","wss://purplepag.es","5"],["zap","63fe6318dc58583cfe16810f86dd09e18bfd76aabc24a0081ce2856f330504ed","wss://purplepag.es","5"]],"content":"[Habla](https://habla.news) now allows to set a publication date for long form content.

Existen cosas simples como las transacciones programadas (agendadas, temporizadas) y los pagos múltiples automatizados, pero indudablemente seguimos atrapados en el pensamiento convencional acerca del flujo de los sats.\n\nQuisiera proponer una idea simple que fue compartida conmigo hace unos meses, con la esperanza de que se distribuya ampliamente y, en el mejor de los casos, alguien la implemente. (O una mejor versión de ella).\n\nEs la siguiente:\n![prisma](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-03-12-lightning-prisms/lightning-prism.png)\n\n_Todo el crédito a [Mr. Kukks](https://nostr.directory/p/MrKukks), quien está oficialmente sin tiempo[^1] para implementarla él mismo._\n\n## Prismas de lightning\n\nUn _prisma de lightning_ es un constructo que permite _\"flujos de división de valor entre direcciones de lightning\"_, parafraseando al autor.\n\nBásicamente, sus características son:\n- un prisma se identifica con una dirección de lightning (o algo similar)\n- un prisma tiene un o múltiples receptores\n- un prisma puede ser receptor de otro, es decir, formar una _\"cadena de prismas\"_\n- las divisiones se definen programáticamente, esto es, con código\n\nEste constructo simple permite todo tipo de casos de uso y puede ser implementado en la capa de las aplicaciones, sin ningún cambio en los protocolos de Bitcoin o Lightning.\n\nUn ejemplo obvio es la división de valor para artículos de blogs y formas similares de escritura de extensión considerable. Imagina si cada artículo (o capítulo de un libro) tuviera su propia dirección de Lightning, repartiendo valor entre autor, editor, ilustrador y revisores del texto automáticamente.\n\nEl concepto de esas divisiones de valor ya existe en el [podcasting 2.0](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md#payment-calculation), donde se aplica ampliamente a podcasts y episodios. Podría argumentarse que tener un identificador separado para el constructo es la evolución natural de esa forma de compartir valor, ya que sería más fácil conceptualizarlos y encadenarlos entre sí.\n\nOtro caso de uso obvio es compartir los _zaps_ de Nostr.\nImagina que cada _tweet citado_ que es zappeado se divide automáticamente, pasando el 50% (o el monto configurado por el usuario) a la nota original. O imagina un prisma creado ad-hoc, repartiendo los zaps equitativamente para todos los etiquetados en una nota. \n\n![split ejemplo](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-03-12-lightning-prisms/lightning-prism-nostr-sat-splits.png)\n_¡Splits de sats para nostr! ¿acaso hay algo mejor?_\n\nComo los pagos son redirigidos, cada prisma actúa como una especie de proxy. Esto puede ser útil tanto para organizaciones como para individuos, ya que tu identificador de pago permanece igual incluso si tu infraestructura subyacente o proveedor de billetera cambian.\n\n## Problemas y mejoras\nExisten dos preocupaciones centrales: **comisiones** y **privacidad**. No sólo hay que tener en cuenta las comisiones derivadas de la división y redirección de los pagos, sino también el hecho de que las direcciones ligthning se basan en IP, lo que tiene ciertas implicaciones de privacidad. Podríamos usar [LNURL sobre nostr](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/pull/203) -de nuevo, créditos para Kukks- que trae a colación la siguiente pregunta: **¿son las direcciones lightning (Lightning Addresses) el nivel de abstracción correcto para los prismas de lightning?**\n\nAl fin y al cabo, no queremos enviar sats a direcciones sino a personas. Si nostr continua tomando vuelo, podría convertirse en sí mismo en la libreta de direcciones global para ese tipo de cosas, en otras palabras, el lugar al que se acude para buscar información de pago de personas, organizaciones y otras entidades. En el futuro, un prisma podría tener múltiples identificadores `nprofile` o `npub` como destinos, detrás de los cuales está la información de pago concreta.\n\n![prisma ejemplo](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-03-12-lightning-prisms/lightning-prism-nostr-npubs.png)\n\n_Los identificadores no tienen que ser necesariamente direcciones lightning (Lightning Addresses). ¡`Npubs` o similares también pueden funcionar!_\n\nEn cualquier caso, en este punto, no estoy demasiado preocupado por los detalles de la implementación. Estoy preocupado por una falta de imaginación, que es a lo que este post intenta responder.\n\nHablando de imaginación: ¿Por qué no tenemos ninguna billetera que automáticamente mueva sats a otra a partir de un cierto umbral? Estoy más que feliz de tener dinero para el almuerzo en una billetera _custodial_ (delegada, controlada por terceros), pero una vez que alcanza tres meses de renta ya no estoy tan cómodo. ¿Por qué no puede la billetera automáticamente enviar el excedente de sats a mi dirección lightning soberana una vez que contiene más que el monto de una cena? O hacer un _loop-out_ mensualmente para mover mis sats a almacenamiento frío?\n\nBueno, divago.\n\nUna mejora que me gustaría ver es que se provean los prismas de forma transparente. En el mejor caso, los usuarios deberían poder ver cómo los pagos se reparten, de una forma fácil de entender y verificar. Una posibilidad es transmitir un evento reemplazable parametrizado (definido por el [NIP-33](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/33.md)) cada vez que un prisma se crea o actualiza. Claro que, dependiendo del caso de uso, puede tener sentido mantener el/los lugar/es finales ocultos del público.\n\nEstoy seguro de que existen más problemas y muchas otras mejoras, pero, como siempre, _lo perfecto es enemigo de lo bueno_, así que hablemos sobre soluciones prácticas que pueden ser implementadas y usadas ahora mismo.\n\n## Implementación\nLos prismas basados en direcciones lightning pueden ser construidos hoy sin demasiado esfuerzo. Podrías incluso construirlo tu mismo sin ninguna experiencia programando utilizando dos extensiones de [LNbits](https://lnbits.com/): [scrub](https://github.com/lnbits/scrub) y [split](https://github.com/lnbits/splitpayments). Agrega [satdress](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/satdress) encima para darle a cada billetera su propia dirección lightning y ¡voilà!, tienes un prisma de lightning. Puedes incluso construir una buena interfaz sobre él, ya que todo lo anterior puede ser creado programáticamente con simples llamadas de API.\n\nHice todo eso (excepto el \"construir una buena interfaz sobre él) para juguetear con la idea. Sí, es algo precaria y probablemente no sea la solución más estable o elegante, pero más o menos funciona y puede ser utilizada hoy.\n\nLa dirección [blogpost@satprism.com](lightning:blogpost@satprism.com) mostrada arriba es un ejemplo en funcionamiento[^2]. Va a dividir los pagos 50/50 entre Kukks y yo (Gigi), dirigiendo los sats a nuestras respectivas direcciones lightning soberanas, provistas por nuestras instancias de [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/).\n\nImagino múltiples servicios siendo creados con una correcta implementación, cargando una pequeña comisión por dicho servicio (sic). (Tal como fue mencionado anteriormente, alguna especie de comisión será requerida por las comisiones de enrutado, ya que los pagos son redirigidos a direcciones externas).\n\nMi esperanza es que ese tipo de ideas y constructos novedosos se vuelvan más prevalentes mientras se van volviendo más prevalentes los [zaps](https://nostr-resources.com/#receiving-zaps) y pagos [V4V](https://value4value.info/) similares, como también la red lightning en general. Claro que, en el mejor escenario, tendremos esas herramientas integradas nativamente a nivel del protocolo, pero no veo razón por la que no deberíamos experimentar un poco con lo que tenemos hoy, incluso si las soluciones son imperfectas. Hasta que el [Bolt12](http://bolt12.org/) y similares sean ubicuos, ensamblar algo que _simplemente funcione_ no es una idea tan terrible[^3].\n\n## Palabras finales\nEspero que esta idea encuentre adopción amplia entre escritores y otros creadores de contenido, tal como la idea de \"_streaming_ sats\" -y los splits de esos streams de valor- encontraron amplia adopción entre podcasters.\n\nLo que aún falta es adjuntar información de pago a eventos individuales (en lugar de a perfiles) para que cada contenido tenga su propia información de pago. Tal vez sea tan simple como extender la metadata del [NIP-23](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/23.md), o tal vez tendría sentido tener este tipo de metadata para otros _kinds_ también.\n\nYa veremos, y por \"vere**mos**\", me refiero a ustedes: los desarrolladores que se sientan a diseñar y construir cosas.\n\nEstaré alentándolos mientras hago [shitpost en nostr](nostr:npub1dergggklka99wwrs92yz8wdjs952h2ux2ha2ed598ngwu9w7a6fsh9xzpc).\n\n![imagen final](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-03-12-lightning-prisms/free-the-bird.jpg)\n\n****\n### Nota del traductor:\nTodas las direcciones lightning, prismas y demás se mantuvieron fieles al post original.

También me tomé la libertad de crear [rhr@satprism.com](lightning:rhr@satprism.com), que hace un split entre Marty y Matt, y también [einundzwanzig@satprism.com](lightning:einundzwanzig@satprism.com) para los hablantes de alemán.\n[^3]: Creé los prismas de ejemplo de forma manual, así que me temo que, hasta que alguien construya una buena interfaz que permita a los usuarios crearlos por sí mismos, no habrá una explosión de prismas. Me gusta crear un montón de billeteras lnbits como a cualquiera, pero crear los splits y redirecciones es cansador después de un rato.\n\n\n¿Te interesa ayudar?

How did it begin?\n\nI joined Substack when it launched and started writing a blog about a lot of general stuff and it had no direction, then during Covid I started getting back into music production, exploring music theory, learning synthesis which led me to becoming deeply fascinated in it all - I originally got into music as a youngster, learnt guitar and some keyboard playing in my teens and into my twenties back in the 90s. I wrote a simple piece of music software on both my Commodore 64 and Amiga 500, later moving on to the PC learning Cubase at the point in time when it was rather fresh to the world - it all made sense and I wrote a few tracks, releasing them on what was known as MP3.com at the time.\n\nFast forward some 20 years or so!\n\nAround 2018, I started getting interested in Ableton and can remember rekindling my Yamaha CS2x to use with it and then two years later during Covid, this became a big thing for me, it helped keep me sane during the lockdowns.\n\nNot long after Covid I started a Substack called Modulations, which makes use of it's blogging tools, audio and video embedding, podcasting and so on. \n\nIt's gained a lot of subscribers, did have some paid subscribers for awhile but since I've lost them, another good reason to gradually move the project over to Nostr.\n## What’s the plan going forward \nI’ve always enjoyed journaling and writing about my music, the tools I use and the tools that I would like to try out in the future; of which there are many of course. These days so many new products are launched every month, all of which I tend to either ignore or add to my “maybe buy someday” list. \n\nThey come in two main forms, software or hardware and then they can all be divided into Synth, Sampler, Sequencer or FX. \n\nThere has been a desire in many to switch to what we call DAWless which I can’t help but think at times is a network effect of YouTubes influencers. Don’t get me wrong many of them are good at what they do and are aware that there are some highly desirable products out on the market. \n\n*For the non computer based musicians out there, who don't know what DAW means, it stands for Digital Audio Workstation.*\n\nDo we need them all though? Do we need to go DAWless, stick with the DAW or go for something in between?\n\nI’m asking this for myself if I’m honest. I bought gear these past few years, sold some because I didn’t gel with it or it was gathering dust. \n\n2025 may well be more of a Hybrid studio year, where I explore using Ableton, in conjunction with some hardware devices.
